## Applicability

This rule applies to any `iframe` element that has a negative number as a `tabindex` [attribute value][].

## Expectation

For each test target, the [nested browsing context][] does not include elements that are [visible][] and part of the [sequential focus navigation][]. An element is "included" in a [nested browsing context][] if its [owner document][] is the [container document][] of the [nested browsing context][].

## Assumptions

This rule assumes that interactive content inside `iframe` elements is used to provide functionality. If the interactive content does not provide functionality, for example a button that does nothing when clicked, [success criterion 2.1.1][sc211] may be satisfied, even if the rule is failed.

## Accessibility Support

There are no major accessibility support issues known for this rule.

## Background

By setting the `tabindex` [attribute value][] of an `iframe` element to `-1` or some other negative number, it becomes impossible to move the focus into the [browsing context][nested browsing context] of the `iframe` element. Even though its content is still included in the [sequential focus navigation][], there is no way to move the focus to any of the items in the `iframe` using standard keyboard navigation.

- [WCAG Technique G202: Ensuring keyboard control for all functionality](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G202)

## Test Cases

### Passed

#### Passed Example 1

This `iframe` element contains no content that is part of [sequential focus navigation][].

```html
<iframe tabindex="-1" srcdoc="<h1>Hello world</h1>"></iframe>
```

#### Passed Example 2

This `iframe` element contains a link that, because of its `tabindex` is not part of [sequential focus navigation][].

```html
<iframe tabindex="-1" srcdoc="<a href='/' tabindex='-1'>Home</a>"></iframe>
```

#### Passed Example 3

This `iframe` element contains no [visible][] content because of the small size of the iframe.

```html
<iframe tabindex="-1" width="1" height="1" srcdoc="<a href='/'>Home</a>"></iframe>
```

### Failed

#### Failed Example 1

This `iframe` element has a link that is part of [sequential focus navigation][].

```html
<iframe tabindex="-1" srcdoc="<a href='/'>Home</a>"></iframe>
```

### Inapplicable

#### Inapplicable Example 1

This `iframe` element does not have a `tabindex` [attribute value][] that is a negative number

```html
<iframe tabindex="0" srcdoc="<a href='/'>Home</a>"></iframe>
```

## Glossary

### Attribute value {#attribute-value}

The _attribute value_ of a content attribute set on an HTML element is the value that the attribute gets after being parsed and computed according to specifications. It may differ from the value that is actually written in the HTML code due to trimming whitespace or non-digits characters, default values, or case-insensitivity.

Some notable case of attribute value, among others:

- For [enumerated attributes][], the _attribute value_ is either the state of the attribute, or the keyword that maps to it; even for the default states. Thus `<input type="image" />` has an attribute value of either `Image Button` (the state) or `image` (the keyword mapping to it), both formulations having the same meaning; similarly, "an input element with a `type` _attribute value_ of `Text`" can be either `<input type="text" />`, `<input />` (missing value default), or `<input type="invalid" />` (invalid value default).
- For [boolean attributes][], the _attribute value_ is `true` when the attribute is present and `false` otherwise. Thus `<button disabled>`, `<button disabled="disabled">` and `<button disabled="">` all have a `disabled` _attribute value_ of `true`.
- For attributes whose value is used in a case-insensitive context, the _attribute value_ is the lowercase version of the value written in the HTML code.
- For attributes that accept [numbers][], the _attribute value_ is the result of parsing the value written in the HTML code according to the rules for parsing this kind of number.
- For attributes that accept sets of tokens, whether [space separated][] or [comma separated][], the _attribute value_ is the set of tokens obtained after parsing the set and, depending on the case, converting its items to lowercase (if the set is used in a case-insensitive context).
- For `aria-*` attributes, the _attribute value_ is computed as indicated in the [WAI-ARIA specification][] and the [HTML Accessibility API Mappings][html aam].

This list is not exhaustive, and only serves as an illustration for some of the most common cases.

The _attribute value_ of an [IDL attribute][] is the value returned on getting it. Note that when an [IDL attribute][] [reflects][reflect] a content attribute, they have the same attribute value.

### Outcome {#outcome}

An _outcome_ is a conclusion that comes from evaluating an ACT Rule on a [test subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-subject) or one of its constituent [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target). An outcome can be one of the three following types:

- **Inapplicable:** No part of the test subject matches the applicability
- **Passed:** A [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target) meets all expectations
- **Failed:** A [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target) does not meet all expectations

**Note:** A rule has one `passed` or `failed` outcome for every [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target). When there are no test targets the rule has one `inapplicable` outcome. This means that each [test subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-subject) will have one or more outcomes.

**Note:** Implementations using the [EARL10-Schema](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/) can express the outcome with the [outcome property](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/#outcome). In addition to `passed`, `failed` and `inapplicable`, EARL 1.0 also defined an `incomplete` outcome. While this cannot be the outcome of an ACT Rule when applied in its entirety, it often happens that rules are only partially evaluated. For example, when applicability was automated, but the expectations have to be evaluated manually. Such "interim" results can be expressed with the `incomplete` outcome.

### Visible {#visible}

Content perceivable through sight.

Content is considered _visible_ if making it fully transparent would result in a difference in the pixels rendered for any part of the document that is currently within the viewport or can be brought into the viewport via scrolling.

[Content is defined in WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-content).

For more details, see [examples of visible](https://act-rules.github.io/pages/examples/visible/).
