## Applicability

This rule applies to any [document element][] if it is an `html` element for which all of the following are true:

- The [document element][] has a `lang` attribute with a value that is a [valid language tag][]; and
- The [document element][] is in a [top-level browsing context][]; and
- The [document element][] has a [content type][] of `text/html`; and
- The [document element][] has a defined [default page language][].

## Expectation

For each test target, the [primary language][] of the [valid language tag][] matches the [default page language][] of the test target.

## Assumptions

- This rule assumes that the default human language of a page, as described in WCAG 2, can be determined by counting the number of words used in each language. If the default language needs to be derived in some other way (such as frequency analysis, mutual information based distance, â€¦), this rule may fail while [Success Criterion 3.1.1: Language of Page](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#language-of-page) is still satisfied.

- The language of the page can be set by other methods than the `lang` attribute, for example using HTTP headers or the `meta` element. These methods are not supported by all assistive technologies. This rule assumes that these other methods are insufficient to satisfying [Success Criterion 3.1.1: Language of Page](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#language-of-page).

- This rule assumes that user agents and assistive technologies can programmatically determine [valid language tags](#valid-language-tag) even if these do not conform to the [BCP 47][] syntax.

- This rule assumes that [grandfathered tags][] are not used as these will not be recognized as [valid language tags](#valid-language-tag).

- This rule assumes that `iframe` title elements are not exposed to assistive technologies and so does not consider them as part of the [default page language][].

## Accessibility Support

_There are no major accessibility support issues known for this rule._

## Background

- [HTML page has `lang` attribute](https://act-rules.github.io/rules/b5c3f8)
- [HTML page `lang` attribute has valid language tag](https://act-rules.github.io/rules/bf051a)
- [Understanding Success Criterion 3.1.1: Language of Page](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/language-of-page.html)
- [H57: Using language attributes on the html element](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H57)
- [BCP 47: Tags for Identifying Languages](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt)
- [The `lang` and `xml:lang` attributes](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#the-lang-and-xml:lang-attributes)

## Test Cases

### Passed

#### Passed Example 1

This page has a `lang` [attribute value][] of `en` (English), which matches the [default language of the page][default page language]. The default language is English because all words are English.

		</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 2

This page has a `lang` attribute value of `en` (English), which matches the [default language of the page][default page language]. The default language is English because all but a few words are English.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<title>Gelukkig</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<p>The Dutch word "gelukkig" has no equivalent in English.</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 3

This page has `lang` attribute value of `nl` (Dutch), which matches the [default language of the page][default page language]. The default language is Dutch because all English words are in a `p` element with a `lang` attribute value of `en`.

```html
<html lang="nl">
	<head>
		<title>Met de kippen op stok</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<blockquote>
			<p>"Hij ging met de kippen op stok"</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p lang="en">
			This Dutch phrase literally translates into "He went to roost with the chickens", but it means that he went to bed
			early.
		</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 4

This page has a `lang` attribute value of `en` (English), which matches the [default language of the page][default page language]. The default language is English because the accessible texts are English, and all other text is in a `p` element with a `lang` attribute value of `nl`.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<title>Fireworks over Paris</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<img src="/test-assets/shared/fireworks.jpg" alt="Fireworks over Paris" />
		<p lang="nl">
			Gelukkig nieuwjaar!
		</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

### Failed

#### Failed Example 1

This page has `lang` attribute value of `da` (Danish), which does not matches the [default language of the page][default page language]. The default language is English because all words are English.

```

#### Failed Example 3

This page has `lang` attribute value of `en` (English), which does not matches the [default language of the page][default page language]. The default language is Dutch because all English words are in a `p` element with a `lang` attribute value of `en`.

```html

	</body>
</html>
```

#### Failed Example 4

This page has a `lang` attribute value of `nl` (Dutch), which does not match the [default language of the page][default page language]. The default language is English because the accessible texts are English, and all other text is in a `p` element with a `lang` attribute value of `nl`.

```html

		</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Failed Example 5

This page has a `lang` attribute value of `nl` (Dutch), which does not match the [default language of the page][default page language]. The default language is English because the accessible name of the `img` element is English. The `lang` attribute on the `p` element is effectively ignored.

```html
<html lang="nl">
	<head>
		<title>Paris</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<img src="/test-assets/shared/fireworks.jpg" aria-labelledby="caption" />

			Fireworks over Paris!
		</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

### Inapplicable

#### Inapplicable Example 1

This is an SVG [document][document element], not an HTML document.

```svg
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" lang="fr"></svg>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 2

This page has an undefined [default language][default page language] because it has no content or [document title][].

```html
<html></html>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 3

This page has an undefined [default language][default page language] because it has no [document title][] and all its content is wrapped in an element with a `lang` attribute.

```html

## Glossary

### Accessible Name {#accessible-name}

The _accessible name_ is the programmatically determined name of a user interface element that is [included in the accessibility tree](#included-in-the-accessibility-tree).

The accessible name is calculated using the [accessible name and description computation][].

For native markup languages, such as HTML and SVG, additional information on how to calculate the accessible name can be found in [HTML Accessibility API Mappings 1.0, Accessible Name and Description Computation (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam/#accessible-name-and-description-computation) and [SVG Accessibility API Mappings, Name and Description (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg-aam/#mapping_additional).

For more details, see [examples of accessible name][].

**Note:** As per the [accessible name and description computation][], each element always has an accessible name. When no accessible name is provided, the element will nonetheless be assigned an empty (`""`) one.

**Note:** As per the [accessible name and description computation][], accessible names are [flat string](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.1/#terminology) trimmed of leading and trailing whitespace. Notably, it is not possible for a non-empty accessible name to be composed only of whitespace since these must be trimmed.

### Attribute value {#attribute-value}

The _attribute value_ of a content attribute set on an HTML element is the value that the attribute gets after being parsed and computed according to specifications. It may differ from the value that is actually written in the HTML code due to trimming whitespace or non-digits characters, default values, or case-insensitivity.

Some notable case of attribute value, among others:

- For [enumerated attributes][], the _attribute value_ is either the state of the attribute, or the keyword that maps to it; even for the default states. Thus `<input type="image" />` has an attribute value of either `Image Button` (the state) or `image` (the keyword mapping to it), both formulations having the same meaning; similarly, "an input element with a `type` _attribute value_ of `Text`" can be either `<input type="text" />`, `<input />` (missing value default), or `<input type="invalid" />` (invalid value default).
- For [boolean attributes][], the _attribute value_ is `true` when the attribute is present and `false` otherwise. Thus `<button disabled>`, `<button disabled="disabled">` and `<button disabled="">` all have a `disabled` _attribute value_ of `true`.
- For attributes whose value is used in a case-insensitive context, the _attribute value_ is the lowercase version of the value written in the HTML code.
- For attributes that accept [numbers][], the _attribute value_ is the result of parsing the value written in the HTML code according to the rules for parsing this kind of number.
- For attributes that accept sets of tokens, whether [space separated][] or [comma separated][], the _attribute value_ is the set of tokens obtained after parsing the set and, depending on the case, converting its items to lowercase (if the set is used in a case-insensitive context).
- For `aria-*` attributes, the _attribute value_ is computed as indicated in the [WAI-ARIA specification][] and the [HTML Accessibility API Mappings][html aam].

This list is not exhaustive, and only serves as an illustration for some of the most common cases.

The _attribute value_ of an [IDL attribute][] is the value returned on getting it. Note that when an [IDL attribute][] [reflects][reflect] a content attribute, they have the same attribute value.

### Default Page Language {#default-page-language}

The _default language of a [web page][]_ is the [most common language][] of its [top-level browsing context](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#top-level-browsing-context) [document][], if it is unique. If this [document][] has either no or several [most common languages][most common language], then it has no default language.

For more details, see [examples of default language][].

### Focusable {#focusable}

Elements that can become the target of keyboard input as described in the [HTML](https://www.w3.org/TR/html) specification of [focusable](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#focusable-area) and [can be focused](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#specially-focusable).

### Included in the accessibility tree {#included-in-the-accessibility-tree}

Elements included in the accessibility tree of platform specific accessibility APIs. Elements in the accessibility tree are exposed to assistive technologies, allowing users to interact with the elements in a way that meet the requirements of the individual user.

The general rules for when elements are included in the accessibility tree are defined in the [core accessibility API mappings](https://www.w3.org/TR/core-aam/). For native markup languages, such as HTML and SVG, additional rules for when elements are included in the accessibility tree can be found in the [HTML accessibility API mappings (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam/) and the [SVG accessibility API mappings (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg-aam/).

For more details, see [examples of included in the accessibility tree][].

**Note:** Users of assistive technologies might still be able to interact with elements that are not included in the accessibility tree. An example of this is a [focusable](#focusable) element with an `aria-hidden` attribute with a value of `true`. Such an element could still be interacted using sequential keyboard navigation regardless of the assistive technologies used, even though the element would not be included in the accessibility tree.
[examples of included in the accessibility tree]: https://act-rules.github.io/pages/examples/included-in-the-accessibility-tree/

### Most Common Language of an Element {#most-common-element-language}

The _most common language of an element_ is determined by counting the number of _words_ in the [text inheriting its programmatic language][] from this element that are part of any of the languages in the [language subtag registry][]. The same word can be part of multiple languages. In case of ties, the element has several most common languages. If there are no words in the [text inheriting its programmatic language][] from the element, then it has no most common language.

For more details, see [examples of most common language][].

### Outcome {#outcome}

An _outcome_ is a conclusion that comes from evaluating an ACT Rule on a [test subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-subject) or one of its constituent [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target). An outcome can be one of the three following types:

- **Inapplicable:** No part of the test subject matches the applicability
- **Passed:** A [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target) meets all expectations
- **Failed:** A [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target) does not meet all expectations

**Note:** A rule has one `passed` or `failed` outcome for every [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target). When there are no test targets the rule has one `inapplicable` outcome. This means that each [test subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-subject) will have one or more outcomes.

**Note:** Implementations using the [EARL10-Schema](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/) can express the outcome with the [outcome property](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/#outcome). In addition to `passed`, `failed` and `inapplicable`, EARL 1.0 also defined an `incomplete` outcome. While this cannot be the outcome of an ACT Rule when applied in its entirety, it often happens that rules are only partially evaluated. For example, when applicability was automated, but the expectations have to be evaluated manually. Such "interim" results can be expressed with the `incomplete` outcome.

### Text Inheriting its Programmatic Language from an Element {#text-inheriting-language}

The _text inheriting its programmatic language_ from an element E is composed of all the following texts:

- **text nodes**: the value of any [text nodes][] that are [visible][] or [included in the accessibility tree][] and children of an element inheriting its programmatic language from E;
- **accessible text**: the [accessible name][] and [accessible description][] of any element inheriting its programmatic language from E, and [included in the accessibility tree][];
- **page title**: the value of the [document title][], only if E is a [document][] in a [top-level browsing context][].

An element F is an _element inheriting its programmatic language_ from an element E if at least one of the following conditions is true (recursively):

- F is E itself (an element always inherits its programmatic language from itself); or
- F does not have a non-empty `lang` attribute, and is the child in the [flat tree][] of an element inheriting its programmatic language from E; or
- F is a [fully active][] [document][] element, has no non-empty `lang` attribute, and its [browsing context container][] is an element inheriting its programmatic language from E.

### Valid Language Tag {#valid-language-tag}

A [language tag][] is _valid_ if its [primary language subtag][] exists in the [language subtag registry][] with a [Type field][] whose field-body value is `language`.

A "language tag" is here to be understood as in the first paragraph of the [BCP 47 language tag syntax][language tag], i.e. a sequence of subtags separated by hyphens, where a subtag is any sequence of alphanumerical characters. Thus, this definition intentionally differs from the strict [BCP 47 syntax][language tag] (and ABNF grammar) as user agents and assistive technologies are more lenient in what they accept. The definition is however consistent with the behavior of the `:lang()` pseudo-selector as defined by [Selectors Level 3][]. For example, `de-hello` would be an accepted way to indicate German in current user agents and assistive technologies, despite not being valid according to [BCP 47 grammar][language tag]. As a consequence of this definition, however, [grandfathered tags][] are not correctly recognized as valid language subtags.

Subtags, notably the [primary language subtag][], are [case insensitive][]. Hence comparison with the [language subtag registry][] must be done in a case insensitive way.

### Visible {#visible}

Content perceivable through sight.

Content is considered _visible_ if making it fully transparent would result in a difference in the pixels rendered for any part of the document that is currently within the viewport or can be brought into the viewport via scrolling.

[Content is defined in WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-content).

For more details, see [examples of visible](https://act-rules.github.io/pages/examples/visible/).

### Web page (HTML) {#web-page-html}

An _HTML [web page](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-web-page-s)_ is the set of all [fully active](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#fully-active) [documents](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-document) which share the same [top-level browsing context](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#top-level-browsing-context).

**Note:** Nesting of browsing context mostly happens with `iframe` and `object`. Thus a web page will most of the time be a "top-level" document and all its `iframe` and `object` (recursively).

**Note:** [Web pages](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-web-page-s) as defined by WCAG are not restricted to the HTML technology but can also include, _e.g._, PDF or DOCX documents.

**Note:** Although web pages as defined here are sets of [documents](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-document) (and do not contain other kind of nodes), one can abusively write that any node is "in a web page" if it is a [shadow-including descendant](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-shadow-including-descendant) of a [document](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-document) that is part of that web page.
