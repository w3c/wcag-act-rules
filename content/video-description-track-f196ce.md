## Applicability

This rule applies to every [non-streaming](#non-streaming-media-element) `video` element that is [visible][] where the video contains audio and a `track` element with a `kind` [attribute value][] of `descriptions`.

## Expectation

The visual information of each test target not available through its audio is described with a description `track` element.

_Note_: Multiple description `track` elements may be useful for different languages, but at least one must match the language of the video.

## Assumptions

- This rule assumes that a mechanism is available to start the video and that the video element is not simply used to display the [poster](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/semantics-embedded-content.html#element-attrdef-video-poster).
- This rule assumes that the language of each test target can be correctly determined (either programmatically or by analyzing the content), and sufficiently understood.

## Accessibility Support

Currently the description track is not supported by most assistive technology. Accessibility support for the description track attribute is relatively low to non-existent. Video players may be able to work around the lack of support for the description track by using aria-live but few do this today.

This means that the rule can only provide a pass for these success criteria if assistive technology support the description track or if the video player that is used has implemented such a work around.

## Background

- [Understanding Success Criterion 1.2.3: Audio Description or Media Alternative (Prerecorded)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/audio-description-or-media-alternative-prerecorded)
- [Understanding Success Criterion 1.2.5: Audio Description (Prerecorded)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/audio-description-prerecorded)
- [G78: Providing a second, user-selectable, audio track that includes audio descriptions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G78)
- [H96: Using the track element to provide audio descriptions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H96)

## Test Cases

### Passed

#### Passed Example 1

A video element with a track element that contains descriptions.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<video controls>
		<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
		<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/video.webm" type="video/webm" />
		<track kind="descriptions" src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/descriptions.vtt" />
	</video>
</html>
```

### Failed

#### Failed Example 1

A video element with a track element that contains incorrect descriptions.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<video controls>
		<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
		<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/video.webm" type="video/webm" />
		<track kind="descriptions" src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/incorrect-descriptions.vtt" />
	</video>
</html>
```

### Inapplicable

#### Inapplicable Example 1

A video element without a track element.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<video controls>
		<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
		<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/video.webm" type="video/webm" />
	</video>
</html>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 2

A video element that is not [visible][].

```html
<html lang="en">
	<video controls style="display: none;">
		<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
		<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/video.webm" type="video/webm" />
		<track kind="descriptions" src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/descriptions.vtt" />
	</video>
</html>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 3

A video element without audio.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<video controls>
		<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/silent.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
		<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/silent.webm" type="video/webm" />
		<track kind="descriptions" src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/descriptions.vtt" />
	</video>
</html>
```

## Glossary

### Attribute value {#attribute-value}

The _attribute value_ of a content attribute set on an HTML element is the value that the attribute gets after being parsed and computed according to specifications. It may differ from the value that is actually written in the HTML code due to trimming whitespace or non-digits characters, default values, or case-insensitivity.

Some notable case of attribute value, among others:

- For [enumerated attributes][], the _attribute value_ is either the state of the attribute, or the keyword that maps to it; even for the default states. Thus `<input type="image" />` has an attribute value of either `Image Button` (the state) or `image` (the keyword mapping to it), both formulations having the same meaning; similarly, "an input element with a `type` _attribute value_ of `Text`" can be either `<input type="text" />`, `<input />` (missing value default), or `<input type="invalid" />` (invalid value default).
- For [boolean attributes][], the _attribute value_ is `true` when the attribute is present and `false` otherwise. Thus `<button disabled>`, `<button disabled="disabled">` and `<button disabled="">` all have a `disabled` _attribute value_ of `true`.
- For attributes whose value is used in a case-insensitive context, the _attribute value_ is the lowercase version of the value written in the HTML code.
- For attributes that accept [numbers][], the _attribute value_ is the result of parsing the value written in the HTML code according to the rules for parsing this kind of number.
- For attributes that accept sets of tokens, whether [space separated][] or [comma separated][], the _attribute value_ is the set of tokens obtained after parsing the set and, depending on the case, converting its items to lowercase (if the set is used in a case-insensitive context).
- For `aria-*` attributes, the _attribute value_ is computed as indicated in the [WAI-ARIA specification][] and the [HTML Accessibility API Mappings][html aam].

This list is not exhaustive, and only serves as an illustration for some of the most common cases.

The _attribute value_ of an [IDL attribute][] is the value returned on getting it. Note that when an [IDL attribute][] [reflects][reflect] a content attribute, they have the same attribute value.

### Non-streaming media element {#non-streaming-media-element}

A _non-streaming media element_ is an [HTML Media Element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#htmlmediaelement) for which the `duration` property is not 0.

### Outcome {#outcome}

An _outcome_ is a conclusion that comes from evaluating an ACT Rule on a [test subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-subject) or one of its constituent [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target). An outcome can be one of the three following types:

- **Inapplicable:** No part of the test subject matches the applicability
- **Passed:** A [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target) meets all expectations
- **Failed:** A [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target) does not meet all expectations

**Note:** A rule has one `passed` or `failed` outcome for every [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target). When there are no test targets the rule has one `inapplicable` outcome. This means that each [test subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-subject) will have one or more outcomes.

**Note:** Implementations using the [EARL10-Schema](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/) can express the outcome with the [outcome property](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/#outcome). In addition to `passed`, `failed` and `inapplicable`, EARL 1.0 also defined an `incomplete` outcome. While this cannot be the outcome of an ACT Rule when applied in its entirety, it often happens that rules are only partially evaluated. For example, when applicability was automated, but the expectations have to be evaluated manually. Such "interim" results can be expressed with the `incomplete` outcome.

### Visible {#visible}

Content perceivable through sight.

Content is considered _visible_ if making it fully transparent would result in a difference in the pixels rendered for any part of the document that is currently within the viewport or can be brought into the viewport via scrolling.

[Content is defined in WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-content).

For more details, see [examples of visible](https://act-rules.github.io/pages/examples/visible/).
