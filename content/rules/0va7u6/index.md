## Applicability

This rule applies to any [image resources][rendered image resources] rendered in a [web page][].

## Expectation

Each test target has no [visible][] [text][human language], except if at least one of the following is true:

- <dfn id="0va7u6:decorative">decorative</dfn>: The image with text is [purely decorative][]; or
- <dfn id="0va7u6:incidental">incidental</dfn>: The text is not a [significant][insignificant] part of the image; or
- <dfn id="0va7u6:essential">essential</dfn>: The presentation of the text is [essential][].

## Assumptions

- This rule assumes that there is no mechanism to change the rendering of text within image resources on the page. For pages that *do* provide such a mechanism, this rule might fail even if [SC 1.4.5 Images of Text][sc1.4.5] is satisfied.
- When used in HTML, the SVG `<text>` element is not considered to be an image of text. This is because like any other element in HTML, SVG `<text>` can be adjusted through custom style sheets. This does not apply for SVG text that is in a separate file, and displayed through, for example, the `img` element.

## Accessibility Support

There are no accessibility support issues known.

## Background

This rule is designed specifically for [SC 1.4.5 Images of Text][sc1.4.5]. There are however only minimal differences between this criterion and [SC 1.4.9 Images of Text (No Exception)][sc1.4.9]. The two differences are that customizable images of text are allowed, and that images of text are allowed when the presentation cannot otherwise be achieved. These scenarios are so rare the rule ignores them as part of the assumptions, and so the [accessibility requirements mapping](#accessibility-requirements-mapping) of these two criteria is the same.

## Glossary

### Attribute value {#attribute-value}

The <dfn id="attribute-value:attribute">attribute value</dfn> of a content attribute set on an HTML element is the value that the attribute gets after being parsed and computed according to specifications. It may differ from the value that is actually written in the HTML code due to trimming whitespace or non-digits characters, default values, or case-insensitivity.

Some notable case of attribute value, among others:

- For [enumerated attributes][], the <dfn id="attribute-value:enumerated">attribute value</dfn> is either the state of the attribute, or the keyword that maps to it; even for the default states. Thus `<input type="image" />` has an attribute value of either `Image Button` (the state) or `image` (the keyword mapping to it), both formulations having the same meaning; similarly, "an input element with a `type` _attribute value_ of `Text`" can be either `<input type="text" />`, `<input />` (missing value default), or `<input type="invalid" />` (invalid value default).
- For [boolean attributes][], the <dfn id="attribute-value:boolean">attribute value</dfn> is `true` when the attribute is present and `false` otherwise. Thus `<button disabled>`, `<button disabled="disabled">` and `<button disabled="">` all have a `disabled` _attribute value_ of `true`.
- For attributes whose value is used in a case-insensitive context, the <dfn id="attribute-value:case-insensitive">attribute value</dfn> is the lowercase version of the value written in the HTML code.
- For attributes that accept [numbers][], the <dfn id="attribute-value:number">attribute value</dfn> is the result of parsing the value written in the HTML code according to the rules for parsing this kind of number.
- For attributes that accept sets of tokens, whether [space separated][] or [comma separated][], the <dfn id="attribute-value:tokens-list">attribute value</dfn> is the set of tokens obtained after parsing the set and, depending on the case, converting its items to lowercase (if the set is used in a case-insensitive context).
- For `aria-*` attributes, the <dfn id="attribute-value:aria">attribute value</dfn> is computed as indicated in the [WAI-ARIA specification][] and the [HTML Accessibility API Mappings][html aam].

This list is not exhaustive, and only serves as an illustration for some of the most common cases.

The <dfn id="attribute-value:idl">attribute value</dfn> of an [IDL attribute][] is the value returned on getting it. Note that when an [IDL attribute][] [reflects][reflect] a content attribute, they have the same attribute value.

### Embedded Image {#embedded-image}

An element presents an _embedded image_ when any of the following is true:

- the element is an `img` element with a non-empty [source set][]; or
- the element is an `input` element with a `type` [attribute value][] of `image` and its `src` [attribute value][] is not empty; or
- the element is an `object` element with a `data` [attribute value][] referencing a resource with an [image MIME type](https://mimesniff.spec.whatwg.org/#image-mime-type); or
- the element is an `svg` element having one or more `image` [descendants][] with a non-empty `href` [attribute value][]; or
- the element has a [computed][] [`background-image`][background-image] CSS property with at least one [`image`][css-image] that is a [url reference][url-reference].

### Essential text presentation {#essential-text-presentation}

The presentation of text is considered essential in one of more of the following scenarios:

1. The text and its presentation is part of a brand; or
2. The text is part of a digitized image of a physical object; or
3. The text is part of a free-form digital illustration; or
4. The text is part of an image with other graphical objects, where its relationship is informative; or
5. Changing part of the presentation would alter the meaning of content on the page.

Examples of text for which the presentation is essential include:

1. Logos, product names, or slogans
2. Image of a hand-written letter, picture of a street sign, or a scanned contract
3. A digital signature, or a note written using a stylus,
4. A bar chart, diagram, or maps with place names
5. An image showing a font, or showing the difference between font-weights

**Note:** WCAG includes a generic definition of "[essential](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/images-of-text.html#dfn-essential)".

### Insignificant {#insignificant}

Content that is neither [purely decorative][], nor required for understanding the purpose of certain pieces of information or functionality. Insignificant content is often used to provide context.

**Example**: A picture of New York's Time Square may include taxis, a famous pizza restaurant, and theater advertisements, etc. None of these are purely decorative. They provide clues as to where the picture was taken. But neither are any of these required to understand the picture as a whole. Even if the picture itself is significant, the taxis in the picture are not.

### Outcome {#outcome}

An _outcome_ is a conclusion that comes from evaluating an ACT Rule on a [test subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-subject) or one of its constituent [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target). An outcome can be one of the three following types:

- **Inapplicable:** No part of the test subject matches the applicability
- **Passed:** A [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target) meets all expectations
- **Failed:** A [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target) does not meet all expectations

**Note:** A rule has one `passed` or `failed` outcome for every [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target). When there are no test targets the rule has one `inapplicable` outcome. This means that each [test subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-subject) will have one or more outcomes.

**Note:** Implementations using the [EARL10-Schema](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/) can express the outcome with the [outcome property](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/#outcome). In addition to `passed`, `failed` and `inapplicable`, EARL 1.0 also defined an `incomplete` outcome. While this cannot be the outcome of an ACT Rule when applied in its entirety, it often happens that rules are only partially evaluated. For example, when applicability was automated, but the expectations have to be evaluated manually. Such "interim" results can be expressed with the `incomplete` outcome.

### Rendered Image Resource {#rendered-image-resource}

A _rendered image resource_ in a [web page][] is any resource with [visible pixels][] that has been specified in the list of [image sources][] of an [embedded image][].

### Visible {#visible}

Content perceivable through sight.

Content is considered _visible_ if making it fully transparent would result in a difference in the pixels rendered for any part of the document that is currently within the viewport or can be brought into the viewport via scrolling.

[Content is defined in WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-content).

For more details, see [examples of visible](https://act-rules.github.io/pages/examples/visible/).

### Web page (HTML) {#web-page-html}

An _HTML [web page](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-web-page-s)_ is the set of all [fully active](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#fully-active) [documents](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-document) which share the same [top-level browsing context](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#top-level-browsing-context).

**Note:** Nesting of browsing context mostly happens with `iframe` and `object`. Thus a web page will most of the time be a "top-level" document and all its `iframe` and `object` (recursively).

**Note:** [Web pages](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-web-page-s) as defined by WCAG are not restricted to the HTML technology but can also include, _e.g._, PDF or DOCX documents.

**Note:** Although web pages as defined here are sets of [documents](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-document) (and do not contain other kind of nodes), one can abusively write that any node is "in a web page" if it is a [shadow-including descendant](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-shadow-including-descendant) of a [document](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-document) that is part of that web page.
