## Applicability

This rule applies to the first `meta` element in a document for which all the following are true:

- the element has an `http-equiv` [attribute value][] of `"refresh"`; and
- the element has a valid `content` [attribute value][], as described in the [meta refresh][] pragma directive.

## Expectation

For each target, the _time_ from the content [attribute value][] is 0. To determine the _time_, run the [shared declarative refresh steps][] on the `meta` element as described in the [HTML refresh state](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#attr-meta-http-equiv-refresh).

## Background

The `meta http-equiv="refresh"` directive is an HTML tag used to instruct browsers to automatically refresh or reload a web page after a specified time interval. This can be useful for updating content dynamically or redirecting users to another page.

The `content` attribute in the `meta http-equiv="refresh"` directive is used to define the time interval, in seconds, after which the browser should automatically refresh or reload the web page. For example, `content="5"` would instruct the browser to refresh the page every 5 seconds. Careful consideration of the refresh interval is crucial to ensure optimal user experience and accessibility, particularly for individuals who may require more time to consume or interact with web content.

Because a refresh with a timing of 0 is effectively a redirect, it is exempt from this rule. Since refreshing the same page with a time of 0 can cause rapid screen flashes it is strongly recommended to avoid this.

### Assumptions

- This rule assumes that no functionality was provided by the website for the user to adjust the timer.

### Accessibility Support

Not all major web browsers parse the value of the `content` attribute in the same way. Some major browsers, when they are unable to parse the value, default to a 0 seconds delay, whereas others will not redirect at all. This can cause some pages to be inapplicable for this rule, while still having a redirect in a minority of web browsers.

### Secondary Requirements

This rule is related to the following accessibility requirements, but was 
not designed to test this requirements directly. These 
[secondary requirements](https://w3c.github.io/wcag-act/act-rules-format.html#secondary-requirements)
can either be stricter than the rule requires, or may be satisfied in ways 
not tested by the rule:

- [2.2.1 Timing Adjustable (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#timing-adjustable): This success criterion is **less strict** than this rule. This is because this criterion allows redirects longer than 20 hours. Some of the failed examples satisfy this success criterion.

## Input Aspects

The following aspects are required in using this rule.

## Glossary

### Attribute value {#attribute-value}

The <dfn id="attribute-value:attribute">attribute value</dfn> of a content attribute set on an HTML element is the value that the attribute gets after being parsed and computed according to specifications. It may differ from the value that is actually written in the HTML code due to trimming whitespace or non-digits characters, default values, or case-insensitivity.

Some notable case of attribute value, among others:

- For [enumerated attributes][], the <dfn id="attribute-value:enumerated">attribute value</dfn> is either the state of the attribute, or the keyword that maps to it; even for the default states. Thus `<input type="image" />` has an attribute value of either `Image Button` (the state) or `image` (the keyword mapping to it), both formulations having the same meaning; similarly, "an input element with a `type` _attribute value_ of `Text`" can be either `<input type="text" />`, `<input />` (missing value default), or `<input type="invalid" />` (invalid value default).
- For [boolean attributes][], the <dfn id="attribute-value:boolean">attribute value</dfn> is `true` when the attribute is present and `false` otherwise. Thus `<button disabled>`, `<button disabled="disabled">` and `<button disabled="">` all have a `disabled` _attribute value_ of `true`.
- For attributes whose value is used in a case-insensitive context, the <dfn id="attribute-value:case-insensitive">attribute value</dfn> is the lowercase version of the value written in the HTML code.
- For attributes that accept [numbers][], the <dfn id="attribute-value:number">attribute value</dfn> is the result of parsing the value written in the HTML code according to the rules for parsing this kind of number.
- For attributes that accept sets of tokens, whether [space separated][] or [comma separated][], the <dfn id="attribute-value:tokens-list">attribute value</dfn> is the set of tokens obtained after parsing the set and, depending on the case, converting its items to lowercase (if the set is used in a case-insensitive context).
- For `aria-*` attributes, the <dfn id="attribute-value:aria">attribute value</dfn> is computed as indicated in the [WAI-ARIA specification][] and the [HTML Accessibility API Mappings][html aam].

This list is not exhaustive, and only serves as an illustration for some of the most common cases.

The <dfn id="attribute-value:idl">attribute value</dfn> of an [IDL attribute][] is the value returned on getting it. Note that when an [IDL attribute][] [reflects][reflect] a content attribute, they have the same attribute value.

### Outcome {#outcome}

A conclusion that comes from evaluating an ACT Rule on a [test subject][] or one of its constituent test target. An outcome can be one of the five following types:

- **Inapplicable:** No part of the test subject matches the applicability
- **Passed:** A [test target][] meets all expectations
- **Failed:** A [test target][] does not meet all expectations
- **cantTell:** Whether the rule is applicable, or not all expectations were met could not be fully determined by the tester.
- **Untested**: The tester has not attempted to evaluate the test subject.

**Note**: A rule has one `passed` or `failed` outcome for every [test target][]. When a tester evaluates a test target it can also be reported as `cantTell` if the rule cannot be tested in its entirety. For example, when applicability was automated, but the expectations have to be evaluated manually.

When there are no test targets the rule has one `inapplicable` outcome. If the tester is unable to determine whether there are test targets there will be one `cantTell` outcome. And when no evaluation has occurred the test target has one untested outcome. This means that each [test subject][] always has one or more outcomes.

Outcomes used in ACT Rules can be expressed using the [outcome property][] of the [[EARL10-Schema]][].
