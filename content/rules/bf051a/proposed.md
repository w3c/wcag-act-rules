## Applicability

This rule applies to any [document element](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#document-element) if it is an `html` element for which all the following are true:

- has a `lang` attribute that is neither empty ("") nor only [ASCII whitespace](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-whitespace); and
- is in a [top-level browsing context](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#top-level-browsing-context); and
- has a [node document](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-node-document) with a [content type](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-document-content-type) of `text/html`.

## Expectation

For each test target, the `lang` attribute has a [known primary language tag][].

## Background

### Assumptions

- The language of the page can be set by other methods than the `lang` attribute, for example using HTTP headers or the `meta` element. These methods are not supported by all assistive technologies. This rule assumes that these other methods are insufficient to satisfying [Success Criterion 3.1.1: Language of Page](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#language-of-page).

- This rule assumes that user agents and assistive technologies can programmatically determine [known primary language tags][known primary language tag] even if these do not conform to the [RFC 5646][] syntax.

- This rule assumes that only [known primary language tags][known primary language tag] are enough to satisfy [Success Criterion 3.1.1 Language of Page][sc311]; this notably excludes [grandfathered tags][] and [ISO 639.2][] three-letters codes, both having poor support in assistive technologies.

### Accessibility Support

There are no accessibility support issues known.

This rule is only applicable to non-embedded HTML pages. HTML pages embedded into other documents, such as through `iframe` or `object` elements are not applicable because they are not [web pages](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-web-page-s) according to the definition in WCAG.

## Glossary

### Known Primary Language Tag {#known-primary-language-tag}

A language tag has a _known primary language tag_ if its [primary language subtag][] exists in the [language subtag registry][] with a [Type field][] whose field-body value is `language`.

A "language tag" is here to be understood as in the first paragraph of the [RFC 5646 language tag syntax][language tag], i.e. a sequence of subtags separated by hyphens, where a subtag is any sequence of alphanumerical characters. [Language tag][] that are not valid according to the stricter [RFC 5646 syntax][language tag] (and ABNF grammar) definition can still have a known primary language tag. User agents and assistive technologies are more lenient in what they accept. This definition is consistent with the behavior of the `:lang()` pseudo-selector as defined by [Selectors Level 3][].

As an example, `de-hello` would be an accepted way to indicate German in current user agents and assistive technologies, despite not being valid according to [RFC 5646 grammar][language tag]. It has a known primary language tag (namely, `de`).

As a consequence of this definition, however, [grandfathered tags][] do not have a known primary language tag.

Subtags, notably the [primary language subtag][], are [case insensitive][]. Comparison with the [language subtag registry][] must be done in a case insensitive way.

### Outcome {#outcome}

A conclusion that comes from evaluating an ACT Rule on a [test subject][] or one of its constituent test target. An outcome can be one of the five following types:

- **Inapplicable:** No part of the test subject matches the applicability
- **Passed:** A [test target][] meets all expectations
- **Failed:** A [test target][] does not meet all expectations
- **cantTell:** Whether the rule is applicable, or not all expectations were met could not be fully determined by the tester.
- **Untested**: The tester has not attempted to evaluate the test subject.

**Note**: A rule has one `passed` or `failed` outcome for every [test target][]. When a tester evaluates a test target it can also be reported as `cantTell` if the rule cannot be tested in its entirety. For example, when applicability was automated, but the expectations have to be evaluated manually.

When there are no test targets the rule has one `inapplicable` outcome. If the tester is unable to determine whether there are test targets there will be one `cantTell` outcome. And when no evaluation has occurred the test target has one untested outcome. This means that each [test subject][] always has one or more outcomes.

Outcomes used in ACT Rules can be expressed using the [outcome property][] of the [[EARL10-Schema]][].
