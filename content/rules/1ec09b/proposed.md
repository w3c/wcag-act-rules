## Applicability

This rule applies to every [non-streaming](#non-streaming-media-element) `video` element that is [visible][], where the video contains audio.

## Expectation

For each test target, the [outcome](#outcome) of at least one of the following rules is passed:

- [`Video` Element Visual Content Has Audio Description](https://act-rules.github.io/rules/1ea59c)
- [`Video` Element Content Is Media Alternative For Text](https://act-rules.github.io/rules/ab4d13)

## Assumptions

- This rule assumes that a mechanism is available to start the video and that the video element is not simply used to display the [poster](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/semantics-embedded-content.html#element-attrdef-video-poster).
- This rule assumes that the language of each test target can be correctly determined (either programmatically or by analyzing the content), and sufficiently understood.

## Accessibility Support

The HTML `video` element can also have a `track` element that provides an audio description. This should provide assistive technologies with a timed text description of visual information in a video. However, there is no native support in any major browser for this technique. Technique [H96: Using the track element to provide audio descriptions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H96) can not be relied upon to conform to [1.2.5: Audio Description (Prerecorded)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#audio-description-prerecorded).

## Input Rules

Outcomes of the following rules are required as input for this rule.

- [`video` element visual content has audio description](/standards-guidelines/act/rules/1ec09b/)
- [`video` element content is media alternative for text](/standards-guidelines/act/rules/1ec09b/)

## Test Cases

### Passed

#### Passed Example 1

A video element with a voiceover that describes the visual information.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<video controls>
		<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/video-with-voiceover.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
		<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/video-with-voiceover.webm" type="video/webm" />
	</video>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 2

A video element that describes some of the text on the same page. The text on the page labels the video as an alternative.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<p>
		Not being able to use your computer because your mouse doesn't work, is frustrating. Many people use only the
		keyboard to navigate websites. Either through preference or circumstance. This is solved by keyboard compatibility.
		Keyboard compatibility is described in WCAG. See the video below to watch the same information again in video form.
	</p>
	<video src="/test-assets/perspective-video/perspective-video.mp4" controls></video>
</html>
```

### Failed

#### Failed Example 1

A video element with an incorrect audio description.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<video controls>
		<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/video-with-incorrect-voiceover.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
		<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/video-with-incorrect-voiceover.webm" type="video/webm" />
	</video>
</html>
```

#### Failed Example 2

A video element with a link to a text transcript.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<video controls>
		<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
		<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/video.webm" type="video/webm" />
	</video>
	<a href="/test-assets/rabbit-video/transcript.html">Transcript</a>
</html>
```

#### Failed Example 3

A video element with a description track element. The description track is not supported.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<video controls>
		<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
		<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/video.webm" type="video/webm" />
		<track kind="descriptions" src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/descriptions.vtt" />
	</video>
</html>
```

### Inapplicable

#### Inapplicable Example 1

A video element without audio.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<video controls>
		<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/silent.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
		<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/silent.webm" type="video/webm" />
	</video>
</html>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 2

A video element that is not [visible][].

```html
<html lang="en">
	<video controls style="display: none;">
		<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
		<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/video.webm" type="video/webm" />
	</video>
</html>
```

## Glossary

### Non-streaming media element {#non-streaming-media-element}

A _non-streaming media element_ is an [HTML Media Element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#htmlmediaelement) for which the `duration` property is not 0.

### Outcome {#outcome}

An _outcome_ is a conclusion that comes from evaluating an ACT Rule on a [test subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-subject) or one of its constituent [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target). An outcome can be one of the three following types:

- **Inapplicable:** No part of the test subject matches the applicability
- **Passed:** A [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target) meets all expectations
- **Failed:** A [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target) does not meet all expectations

**Note:** A rule has one `passed` or `failed` outcome for every [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target). When there are no test targets the rule has one `inapplicable` outcome. This means that each [test subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-subject) will have one or more outcomes.

**Note:** Implementations using the [EARL10-Schema](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/) can express the outcome with the [outcome property](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/#outcome). In addition to `passed`, `failed` and `inapplicable`, EARL 1.0 also defined an `incomplete` outcome. While this cannot be the outcome of an ACT Rule when applied in its entirety, it often happens that rules are only partially evaluated. For example, when applicability was automated, but the expectations have to be evaluated manually. Such "interim" results can be expressed with the `incomplete` outcome.

### Visible {#visible}

Content perceivable through sight.

Content is considered _visible_ if making it fully transparent would result in a difference in the pixels rendered for any part of the document that is currently within the viewport or can be brought into the viewport via scrolling.

[Content is defined in WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-content).

For more details, see [examples of visible](https://act-rules.github.io/pages/examples/visible/).
