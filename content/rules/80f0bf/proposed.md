    - handle: Audio Control
      num: 1.4.2
      level: A
---

## Applicability

This rule applies to any `audio` or `video` element for which all the following are true:

- **autoplay**: the element has an `autoplay` [attribute value][] of `true`; and
- **not muted**: the element has a `muted` [attribute value][] of `false`; and
- **not paused**: the element has a `paused` [attribute value][] of `false`; and
- **duration**: the element has a [media resource][] lasting more than 3 seconds and that contains audio.

## Expectation

For each test target, the [outcome](#outcome) of at least one of the following rules is passed:

- [Audio Or Video That Plays Automatically Has A Control Mechanism](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/4c31df/)
- [Audio Or Video That Plays Automatically Has No Audio That Lasts More Than 3 Seconds](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/aaa1bf/)

## Background

The [instruments][instrument] used to pass this rule (if any), must meet all level A Success Criteria in order to fully satisfy [Success Criterion 1.4.2 Audio Control][sc142]. These extra requirements are left out of this rule, and should be tested separately.

### Assumptions

- This rule assumes that it is not possible to satisfy [Success Criterion 1.4.2 Audio Control][sc142] if the total length of the automatically playing audio is more than 3 seconds, even if there are pauses in the sound and no more than 3 seconds in a row with actual sound.
- This rule assumes that the [mechanism](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-mechanism) to control the sound must be located in the same [web page][]. Mechanisms located on other pages can still create accessibility issues for users relying on sound to navigate (e.g. screen readers users) since the autoplaying sound will interfere with their ability to find and activate the mechanism. If a [mechanism](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-mechanism) external to the [web page][] is provided, it is possible to fail this rule but still satisfy [Success Criterion 1.4.2 Audio Control][sc142].
- This rule assumes that the [mechanism](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-mechanism) to control the sound must be visible and accessible in order to be effective and usable by all kinds of users. If the mechanism is hidden to some users, it is possible to fail this rule but still satisfy [Success Criterion 1.4.2 Audio Control][sc142].

### Accessibility Support

The native `video` and `audio` controls in several browser and assistive technology combinations are not keyboard accessible and the `video` or `audio` element itself may not be announced. Authors are recommended to use custom controls for keyboard navigation and cross browser accessibility support in general. Some major browsers no longer automatically play the 'video' unless the 'video' is muted.

User agents do not always automatically play media, even when an `autoplay` attribute is present. This is done to avoid autoplaying media interrupting the user when they do not want to, especially when the media is likely to contain sound. The decision to respect the `autoplay` attribute or not depends on user settings and previous behavior (interaction with the site). Therefore, some media files may fail this rule but satisfy [Success Criterion 1.4.2 Audio Control][sc142] on some combination of User Agent and user settings. The rule considers that the presence of the `autoplay` attribute is an indication of the author intention to have automatically playing media, and therefore requires the author to provide a mechanism to control the sound.

## Glossary

### Attribute value {#attribute-value}

The <dfn id="attribute-value:attribute">attribute value</dfn> of a content attribute set on an HTML element is the value that the attribute gets after being parsed and computed according to specifications. It may differ from the value that is actually written in the HTML code due to trimming whitespace or non-digits characters, default values, or case-insensitivity.

Some notable case of attribute value, among others:

- For [enumerated attributes][], the <dfn id="attribute-value:enumerated">attribute value</dfn> is either the state of the attribute, or the keyword that maps to it; even for the default states. Thus `<input type="image" />` has an attribute value of either `Image Button` (the state) or `image` (the keyword mapping to it), both formulations having the same meaning; similarly, "an input element with a `type` _attribute value_ of `Text`" can be either `<input type="text" />`, `<input />` (missing value default), or `<input type="invalid" />` (invalid value default).
- For [boolean attributes][], the <dfn id="attribute-value:boolean">attribute value</dfn> is `true` when the attribute is present and `false` otherwise. Thus `<button disabled>`, `<button disabled="disabled">` and `<button disabled="">` all have a `disabled` _attribute value_ of `true`.
- For attributes whose value is used in a case-insensitive context, the <dfn id="attribute-value:case-insensitive">attribute value</dfn> is the lowercase version of the value written in the HTML code.
- For attributes that accept [numbers][], the <dfn id="attribute-value:number">attribute value</dfn> is the result of parsing the value written in the HTML code according to the rules for parsing this kind of number.
- For attributes that accept sets of tokens, whether [space separated][] or [comma separated][], the <dfn id="attribute-value:tokens-list">attribute value</dfn> is the set of tokens obtained after parsing the set and, depending on the case, converting its items to lowercase (if the set is used in a case-insensitive context).
- For `aria-*` attributes, the <dfn id="attribute-value:aria">attribute value</dfn> is computed as indicated in the [WAI-ARIA specification][] and the [HTML Accessibility API Mappings][html aam].

This list is not exhaustive, and only serves as an illustration for some of the most common cases.

The <dfn id="attribute-value:idl">attribute value</dfn> of an [IDL attribute][] is the value returned on getting it. Note that when an [IDL attribute][] [reflects][reflect] a content attribute, they have the same attribute value.

### Instrument to achieve an objective {#instrument-to-achieve-an-objective}

An [HTML element][] that when [activated][] allows an end-user to achieve an objective.

**Note**: Any rule that uses this definition must provide an unambiguous description of the objective the instrument is used to achieve.

### Outcome {#outcome}

A conclusion that comes from evaluating an ACT Rule on a [test subject][] or one of its constituent test target. An outcome can be one of the five following types:

- **Inapplicable:** No part of the test subject matches the applicability
- **Passed:** A [test target][] meets all expectations
- **Failed:** A [test target][] does not meet all expectations
- **cantTell:** Whether the rule is applicable, or not all expectations were met could not be fully determined by the tester.
- **Untested**: The tester has not attempted to evaluate the test subject.

**Note**: A rule has one `passed` or `failed` outcome for every [test target][]. When a tester evaluates a test target it can also be reported as `cantTell` if the rule cannot be tested in its entirety. For example, when applicability was automated, but the expectations have to be evaluated manually.

When there are no test targets the rule has one `inapplicable` outcome. If the tester is unable to determine whether there are test targets there will be one `cantTell` outcome. And when no evaluation has occurred the test target has one untested outcome. This means that each [test subject][] always has one or more outcomes.

Outcomes used in ACT Rules can be expressed using the [outcome property][] of the [[EARL10-Schema]][].

### Web page (HTML) {#web-page-html}

An _HTML [web page](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-web-page-s)_ is the set of all [fully active](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#fully-active) [documents](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-document) which share the same [top-level browsing context](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#top-level-browsing-context).

**Note:** Nesting of browsing context mostly happens with `iframe` and `object`. Thus a web page will most of the time be a "top-level" document and all its `iframe` and `object` (recursively).

**Note:** [Web pages](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-web-page-s) as defined by WCAG are not restricted to the HTML technology but can also include, _e.g._, PDF or DOCX documents.

**Note:** Although web pages as defined here are sets of [documents](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-document) (and do not contain other kind of nodes), one can abusively write that any node is "in a web page" if it is a [shadow-including descendant](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-shadow-including-descendant) of a [document](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-document) that is part of that web page.
