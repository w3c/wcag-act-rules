## Applicability

This rule applies to any [HTML element][] with one or more [visible][] [text node][] children, when the text inside the elements includes a [soft wrap break][] and all the following are true for the `line-height` property of the element:

- the [specified][] value is [declared][] in a `style` attribute; and
- the [computed][] value is [important][].

## Expectation

For each test target, the [used][] value of its `line-height` property is at least 1.5 times the [computed][] value of its `font-size` property.

## Background

Styles [declared][] in a `style` attribute have higher [cascade specificity][] than any selector; therefore, they "win" the [cascade sort] over any other style from [author origin][], i.e. it cannot be overridden by any of these. On the other hand, if such a style is [declared][] in a style sheet, it can still "lose" the [cascade sort][] to declarations with higher [specificity][] or simply coming from a later style sheet (such as ones injected by assistive technologies). This rule ensures that the element is not in the first case and that the style can be overridden by users, unless it is already at least the minimum required threshold. [Important][] styles that are declared with the [user][user origin] or [user agent][user agent origin] can win the [cascade sort][] over styles with the [author origin][].

CSS specifications define each declaration as being either [important][] (if it has the `!important` annotation) or [normal][]. Given that `normal` is also a keyword for some properties, and that `!important` is wider known than this distinction, this rule rather uses "[important][]"/"not [important][]" to avoid confusion.

This rule evaluates the [used][] value of the `line-height` property instead of its [computed][] value because the [used][] value is guaranteed to use absolute units (i.e., pixels). This streamlines comparison with the [computed][] `font-size` which is also absolute. The [computed][] `line-height` may be a unitless number that is harder to compare.

### Assumptions

- There is no mechanism available on the page to adjust `line-height`. If there is such a mechanism, it is possible to fail this rule while [Success Criterion 1.4.12 Text Spacing][sc1412] is still satisfied.

- The font size is constant for all text in the element. If font-size changes (e.g., through use of the `::first-line` pseudo-element) then the required line height would also change throughout the element. This is untested by the current rule.

- No other style attributes are used to increase or decrease the distance between lines of text. For example, style attributes such as `position`, `padding`, and `margin` could be used to increase the distance between lines of text to meet [Success Criterion 1.4.12 Text Spacing][sc1412]. Oppositely, those style attributes could also be used to reduce the distance between lines of text. Thus, it is possible to pass this rule, but still fail [Success Criterion 1.4.12 Text Spacing][sc1412] due to other styling choices.

- The text in the element express something in a human language written in a script that uses the `line-height` property.

### Accessibility Support

While some assistive technologies are able to set [user origin][] or [user agent origin][] styles, others, such as browser extensions, are only able to set styles with the [author origin][]. Such assistive technologies cannot create styles "winning" the [cascade sort][] over a `style` attribute with an [important][] declaration.

## Glossary

### Namespaced Element {#namespaced-element}

An [element][] with a specific [namespaceURI][] value from [HTML namespaces][]. For example an "SVG element" is any element with the "SVG namespace", which is `http://www.w3.org/2000/svg`.

Namespaced elements are not limited to elements described in a specification. They also include custom elements. Elements such as `a` and `title` have a different namespace depending on where they are used. For example a `title` in an HTML page usually has the HTML namespace. When used in an `svg` element, a `title` element has the SVG namespace instead.

### Outcome {#outcome}

A conclusion that comes from evaluating an ACT Rule on a [test subject][] or one of its constituent test target. An outcome can be one of the five following types:

- **Inapplicable:** No part of the test subject matches the applicability
- **Passed:** A [test target][] meets all expectations
- **Failed:** A [test target][] does not meet all expectations
- **cantTell:** Whether the rule is applicable, or not all expectations were met could not be fully determined by the tester.
- **Untested**: The tester has not attempted to evaluate the test subject.

**Note**: A rule has one `passed` or `failed` outcome for every [test target][]. When a tester evaluates a test target it can also be reported as `cantTell` if the rule cannot be tested in its entirety. For example, when applicability was automated, but the expectations have to be evaluated manually.

When there are no test targets the rule has one `inapplicable` outcome. If the tester is unable to determine whether there are test targets there will be one `cantTell` outcome. And when no evaluation has occurred the test target has one untested outcome. This means that each [test subject][] always has one or more outcomes.

Outcomes used in ACT Rules can be expressed using the [outcome property][] of the [[EARL10-Schema]][].

### Visible {#visible}

Content perceivable through sight.

Content is considered _visible_ if making it fully transparent would result in a difference in the pixels rendered for any part of the document that is currently within the viewport or can be brought into the viewport via scrolling.

[Content is defined in WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-content).
