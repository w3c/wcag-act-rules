    This rule checks that each `aria-` attribute specified is defined in ARIA 1.2.
  last_modified: 21 November 2024
---

## Applicability

This rule applies to any attribute that starts with `aria-`.

## Expectation

Each target attribute is defined in [WAI-ARIA Specifications][].

## Background

The presence of unknown ARIA attributes is often the result of a typo or other developer error. These attributes are ignored by browsers and other assistive technologies. This often means that a state or property which should exist is missing.

### Assumptions

There are no assumptions.

### Accessibility Support

There are no accessibility support issues known.

## Accessibility Requirements Mapping

### Secondary Requirements

This rule is related to the following accessibility requirements, but was 
not designed to test this requirements directly. These 
[secondary requirements](https://w3c.github.io/wcag-act/act-rules-format.html#secondary-requirements)
can either be stricter than the rule requires, or may be satisfied in ways 
not tested by the rule:

- [1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#info-and-relationships): This success criterion is **less strict** than this rule. This is because the rule does not ignore irrelevant ARIA properties. Some of the failed examples satisfy this success criterion.
- [4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#name-role-value): This success criterion is **less strict** than this rule. This is because the rule does not ignore irrelevant ARIA properties. Some of the failed examples satisfy this success criterion.

## Input Aspects

## Glossary

### Outcome {#outcome}

A conclusion that comes from evaluating an ACT Rule on a [test subject][] or one of its constituent test target. An outcome can be one of the five following types:

- **Inapplicable:** No part of the test subject matches the applicability
- **Passed:** A [test target][] meets all expectations
- **Failed:** A [test target][] does not meet all expectations
- **cantTell:** Whether the rule is applicable, or not all expectations were met could not be fully determined by the tester.
- **Untested**: The tester has not attempted to evaluate the test subject.

**Note**: A rule has one `passed` or `failed` outcome for every [test target][]. When a tester evaluates a test target it can also be reported as `cantTell` if the rule cannot be tested in its entirety. For example, when applicability was automated, but the expectations have to be evaluated manually.

When there are no test targets the rule has one `inapplicable` outcome. If the tester is unable to determine whether there are test targets there will be one `cantTell` outcome. And when no evaluation has occurred the test target has one untested outcome. This means that each [test subject][] always has one or more outcomes.

Outcomes used in ACT Rules can be expressed using the [outcome property][] of the [[EARL10-Schema]][].

### WAI-ARIA specifications {#wai-aria-specifications}

The _WAI ARIA Specifications_ group both the WAI ARIA W3C Recommendation and ARIA modules, namely:

- [Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) 1.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/)
- [WAI-ARIA Graphics Module 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/graphics-aria-1.0/)
- [Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/dpub-aria-1.0/)

**Note:** depending on the type of content being evaluated, part of the specifications might be irrelevant and should be ignored.
