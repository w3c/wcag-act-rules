## Applicability

This rule applies to any [text node][] that is either [visible][] or [included in the accessibility tree][].

## Expectation

For each test target, either it contains none of the [visual reference words][], or it does not identify any [web content][] through the use of any [visual reference words][], or it does identify some [web content][] and at least one of the following is true:

- **non-visual reference**: the test target is on the same [web page][] as a [textual][text] instruction that also identifies that [web content][] without any [visual reference word][]; or
- **non-sensory meaning**: at least one of the [visual reference words][] that identifies the [web content][] is used with a non-sensory meaning; or
- **visible words**: each [visual reference word][] in the test target is included in the [visible text content][] of the identified content; or
- **accessible words**: each [visual reference word][] in the test target is included in the [accessible name][] of the identified content; or
- **no instruction**: the test target does not give instructions about it through the use of any of the [visual reference words][].

## Assumptions

This rule assumes that [visual reference words][] are forms of information conveyed through visual presentation. Therefore, failing this rule fails [Success Criterion 1.3.3 Sensory Characteristics][sc133]. Visual presentation is not limited to CSS and includes images such as the image of a circle with text.

## Accessibility Support

There are no accessibility support issues known.

## Background

[Visual reference words][] that can be interpreted with the non-sensory meaning include, in English, expressions like "right after this" where "right" is a [visual reference word][] used with the meaning "immediately"; or words like "below" that is often used with the meaning "further in reading order".

The rule doesn't require the non-visual characteristic description to be included in the accessibility tree. If the alternatives are not included in the accessibility tree, only [Success Criteria 1.3.1 Info and Relationships][sc131] would fail instead of [Success Criterion 1.3.3 Sensory Characteristics][sc133]. Hence, the rule passes in these cases as it is not a failure of the accessibility requirements of this rule.

The identified web content does not have to be positioned on the same web page and doesn't need to be linked to from the tested web page.

#### Passed Example 1

<a class="example-link" title="Passed Example 1" target="_blank" href="https://w3.org/WAI/content-assets/wcag-act-rules/testcases/9bd38c/6edd8b8ec9bb14d8f35763e549f01cc21b3ef161.html">Open in a new tab</a>

This paragraph includes the [visual reference word][] "right". The content in the second column is identified with the word "right" but also identified by referencing the word "howdy", thus matching the **non-visual reference** condition.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<title>Passed example 1 9bd38c</title>
		<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/test-assets/non-visual-reference-alternative-9bd38c/columns.css" />
	</head>
	<body>
		<div class="col-container">

This paragraph includes the [visual reference word][] "below" which can here be accurately interpreted as "further in the reading order". Hence, the paragraph matches the **non-sensory meaning** condition.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<p>Interact with the button below this paragraph, for a surprise</p>
	<button onclick="alert('Surprise!')">Howdy</button>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 3

This paragraph includes the [visual reference word][] "right". The visual reference made by the word "right" is complemented by the non-visual reference made by the word "menu" to the content identified by the "Menu" heading, thus matching the **non-visual reference** condition.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<title>Passed example 3 9bd38c</title>
		<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/test-assets/non-visual-reference-alternative-9bd38c/columns.css" />

This text includes the [visual reference word][] "tilted" and identifies web content (namely itself). But the text also includes the word "this" which makes it apparent that the description is about the same content, thus matching the **non-visual reference** condition.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<title>Passed example 4 9bd38c</title>
		<style>
			div.tilt {
				height: 750px;

This paragraph includes the [visual reference word][] "round". The button is identified by this word which is also included in the [visible text content][] of the element, thus matching the **visible words** condition.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<title>Passed example 5 9bd38c</title>

This paragraph includes the [visual reference word][] "triangle" which is included in the heading of the menu, thus matching the **visible words** condition. The fact that the described content is on another page of the same website does not restrict this rule.

```html
<html lang="en">

This paragraph includes the [visual reference words][] "wide" and "narrow". The images are indicated by these words which are also included in the [accessible names][accessible name] of the images, thus matching the **accessible words** condition.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<p>The wide image is awesome. The narrow image isn't.</p>
	<img

This paragraph includes the [visual reference words][] "square" and "right" but in this case they are not identifying any [web content][].

```html
<html lang="en">
	<p>A square is a regular quadrilateral with four equal sides and four right angles.</p>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 9

<a class="example-link" title="Passed Example 9" target="_blank" href="https://w3.org/WAI/content-assets/wcag-act-rules/testcases/9bd38c/4b4ad8012cb0399cf60658adbdfebfc09b5dbbf3.html">Open in a new tab</a>

This paragraph includes the [visual reference word][] "circle" but in this case it is not an instruction about any [web content][], thus matching the **no instruction** condition.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<p>
		This circle is nice.
		<span
			role="presentation"
			style="height: 25px;
		     width: 25px;

This paragraph includes the [visual reference word][] "star" but there is also a heading "examples" that can be referenced, thus matching the **non-visual references** condition. The fact that the identified content is in an `iframe` does not restrict this rule.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<p>More examples can be found when you look underneath the star or you can search for the "Examples" heading</p>
	<iframe title="star" src="/test-assets/non-visual-reference-alternative-9bd38c/star-with-heading.html"></iframe>

This paragraph includes the [visual reference word][] "right". The content in the second column is identified with the word "right" but also identified by referencing the word "howdy", thus matching the **non-visual reference** condition. Note that, despite the fact that the text is not visible, this example is applicable because it is included in the accessibility tree.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<head>

This paragraph includes the [visual reference word][] "green". The content in the second column is identified with the word "green" but also identified by referencing the word "howdy", thus matching the **non-visual reference** condition. Note that, despite the fact that the text is not included in the accessibility tree, this example is applicable because it is visible.

```html

This paragraph includes the [visual reference word][] "right". The user is told to find the navigation on the right and the navigation is also correctly identified by a `nav` element whose [accessible name][] contains the word "navigation", thus matching the **non-visual reference** condition.

```html

No [text node][] on this page includes any of the [visual reference words][].

```html
<html lang="en">
	<p>Click the button, for a surprise</p>
	<button onclick="alert('Surprise!')">Howdy</button>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 15

<a class="example-link" title="Passed Example 15" target="_blank" href="https://w3.org/WAI/content-assets/wcag-act-rules/testcases/9bd38c/d76ef447c5266fed36f05cbe00cf2a11b649f652.html">Open in a new tab</a>

No [text node][] on this page includes any of the [visual reference words][]. The word "square" in French (the language of the page) never has the meaning of the geometrical figure. Hence, it is not the translation of any of the [visual reference words][]. The sentence means "After school, he's taking his kids to the public garden."

```html
<html lang="fr">
	<p>
		Après l'école, il emmène ses enfants jouer au square.
	</p>
</html>
```

This paragraph includes the [visual reference word][] "right". The user is told to find the navigation on the right and the navigation is correctly identified by a `nav` element, but there are 2 `nav` elements on the page so the user doesn't know which one to use (the non-visual reference is ambiguous and does not identify a specific [web content][]).

## Glossary

### Accessible Name {#accessible-name}

The _accessible name_ is the programmatically determined name of a user interface element that is [included in the accessibility tree](#included-in-the-accessibility-tree).

The accessible name is calculated using the [accessible name and description computation][].

For native markup languages, such as HTML and SVG, additional information on how to calculate the accessible name can be found in [HTML Accessibility API Mappings 1.0, Accessible Name and Description Computation (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam/#accessible-name-and-description-computation) and [SVG Accessibility API Mappings, Name and Description (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg-aam/#mapping_additional).

For more details, see [examples of accessible name][].

**Note:** As per the [accessible name and description computation][], each element always has an accessible name. When no accessible name is provided, the element will nonetheless be assigned an empty (`""`) one.

**Note:** As per the [accessible name and description computation][], accessible names are [flat string](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.1/#terminology) trimmed of leading and trailing whitespace. Notably, it is not possible for a non-empty accessible name to be composed only of whitespace since these must be trimmed.

### Focusable {#focusable}

An element is _focusable_ if one or both of the following are true:

- the element is part of [sequential focus navigation][]; or
- the element has a [tabindex value][] that is not null.

**Exception**: Elements that lose focus during a period of up to 1 second after gaining focus, without the user interacting with the page the element is on, are not considered _focusable_.

Notes:

- The 1 second time span is an arbitrary limit which is not included in WCAG. Given that scripts can manage the focus state of elements, testing the focusability of an element consistently would be impractical without a time limit.
- The [tabindex value][] of an element is the value of the [tabindex attribute][] parsed using the [rules for parsing integers][]. For the [tabindex value][] to be different from null, it needs to be [parsed][rules for parsing integers] without errors.

### Included in the accessibility tree {#included-in-the-accessibility-tree}

Elements included in the accessibility tree of platform specific accessibility APIs are exposed to assistive technologies. This allows users of assistive technology to access the elements in a way that meets the requirements of the individual user.

The general rules for when elements are included in the accessibility tree are defined in the [core accessibility API mappings](https://www.w3.org/TR/core-aam/). For native markup languages, such as HTML and SVG, additional rules for when elements are included in the accessibility tree can be found in the [HTML accessibility API mappings (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam/) and the [SVG accessibility API mappings (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg-aam/).

For more details, see [examples of included in the accessibility tree][].

[Programmatically hidden](#programmatically-hidden) elements are removed from the accessibility tree. However, some browsers will leave [focusable](#focusable) elements with an `aria-hidden` attribute set to `true` in the accessibility tree. Because they are hidden, these elements are considered **not** included in the accessibility tree. This may cause confusion for users of assistive technologies because they may still be able to interact with these focusable elements using sequential keyboard navigation, even though the element should not be included in the accessibility tree.

### Outcome {#outcome}

An _outcome_ is a conclusion that comes from evaluating an ACT Rule on a [test subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-subject) or one of its constituent [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target). An outcome can be one of the three following types:

- **Inapplicable:** No part of the test subject matches the applicability
- **Passed:** A [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target) meets all expectations
- **Failed:** A [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target) does not meet all expectations

**Note:** A rule has one `passed` or `failed` outcome for every [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target). When there are no test targets the rule has one `inapplicable` outcome. This means that each [test subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-subject) will have one or more outcomes.

**Note:** Implementations using the [EARL10-Schema](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/) can express the outcome with the [outcome property](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/#outcome). In addition to `passed`, `failed` and `inapplicable`, EARL 1.0 also defined an `incomplete` outcome. While this cannot be the outcome of an ACT Rule when applied in its entirety, it often happens that rules are only partially evaluated. For example, when applicability was automated, but the expectations have to be evaluated manually. Such "interim" results can be expressed with the `incomplete` outcome.

### Programmatically Hidden {#programmatically-hidden}

An HTML element is _programmatically hidden_ if either it has a [computed][] CSS property `visibility` whose value is not `visible`; or at least one of the following is true for any of its [inclusive ancestors][] in the [flat tree][]:

- has a [computed][] CSS property `display` of `none`; or
- has an `aria-hidden` attribute set to `true`

**Note**: Contrary to the other conditions, the `visibility` CSS property may be reverted by descendants.

**Note**: The [HTML standard suggests](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/rendering.html#hidden-elements) setting the CSS `display` property to `none` for elements with the `hidden` attribute. While not required by HTML, all modern browsers follow this suggestion. Because of this the `hidden` attribute is not used in this definition. In browsers that use this suggestion, overriding the CSS `display` property can reveal elements with the `hidden` attribute.

### Visible {#visible}

Content perceivable through sight.

Content is considered _visible_ if making it fully transparent would result in a difference in the pixels rendered for any part of the document that is currently within the viewport or can be brought into the viewport via scrolling.

[Content is defined in WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-content).

For more details, see [examples of visible](https://act-rules.github.io/pages/examples/visible/).

### Visible Text Content {#visible-text-content}

The _visible text content_ of an [element][] is a set of all [visible][] [text nodes][] that are [descendants][] in the [flat tree][] of this element

### Visual Reference Words {#visual-reference-words}

Any word in a text node that is included in the translated version of the following lists, where the language of the translation is the programmatically determinable language of the text node. Some words can be translated in multiple ways or have plural forms. In such cases each translation or form must be included. Some words can be spelled in multiple ways (For example: sometimes the word is capitalized and sometimes it isn't). In such cases each spelling must be included.

**Note:** This list is not exhaustive. As soon as more visual reference words are found they can be added to this list.
