    This rule checks non-streaming silent `video` is a media alternative for text on the page.
  last_modified: 21 November 2024
---

## Applicability

This rule applies to any [non-streaming](#non-streaming-media-element) `video` element that is [visible][] where the video does not contain audio.

## Expectation 1

All the information contained in each target element is available as text (directly or via text alternatives) that is [visible][] and [included in the accessibility tree][].

## Expectation 2

Each target element is labeled as a video alternative for text on the page by content that is [visible][] and [included in the accessibility tree][].

## Background

The term [label](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-labels) used in expectations 2 and 3 does not refer to the `label` element.

### Assumptions

A mechanism is available to start the video and that the video element is not simply used to display the [poster](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/semantics-embedded-content.html#element-attrdef-video-poster).

### Accessibility Support

There are no accessibility support issues known.

## Accessibility Requirements Mapping

This rule is not required for conformance.

## Input Aspects

The following aspects are required in using this rule.

## Glossary

### Focusable {#focusable}

An element is _focusable_ if one or both of the following are true:

- the element is part of [sequential focus navigation][]; or
- the element has a [tabindex value][] that is not null.

**Exception**: Elements that lose focus and do not regain focus during a period of up to 1 second after gaining focus, without the user interacting with the page the element is on, are not considered _focusable_.

Notes:

- The 1 second time span is an arbitrary limit which is not included in WCAG. Given that scripts can manage the focus state of elements, testing the focusability of an element consistently would be impractical without a time limit.
- The [tabindex value][] of an element is the value of the [tabindex attribute][] parsed using the [rules for parsing integers][]. For the [tabindex value][] to be different from null, it needs to be [parsed][rules for parsing integers] without errors.

### Included in the accessibility tree {#included-in-the-accessibility-tree}

Elements included in the accessibility tree of platform specific accessibility APIs are exposed to assistive technologies. This allows users of assistive technology to access the elements in a way that meets the requirements of the individual user.

The general rules for when elements are included in the accessibility tree are defined in the [core accessibility API mappings](https://www.w3.org/TR/core-aam/). For native markup languages, such as HTML and SVG, additional rules for when elements are included in the accessibility tree can be found in the [HTML accessibility API mappings (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam/) and the [SVG accessibility API mappings (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg-aam/).

For more details, see [examples of included in the accessibility tree][].

[Programmatically hidden](#programmatically-hidden) elements are removed from the accessibility tree. However, some browsers will leave [focusable](#focusable) elements with an `aria-hidden` attribute set to `true` in the accessibility tree. Because they are hidden, these elements are considered **not** included in the accessibility tree. This may cause confusion for users of assistive technologies because they may still be able to interact with these focusable elements using sequential keyboard navigation, even though the element should not be included in the accessibility tree.

### Non-streaming media element {#non-streaming-media-element}

A _non-streaming media element_ is an [HTML Media Element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#htmlmediaelement) for which the `duration` property is not 0.

### Outcome {#outcome}

A conclusion that comes from evaluating an ACT Rule on a [test subject][] or one of its constituent test target. An outcome can be one of the five following types:

- **Inapplicable:** No part of the test subject matches the applicability
- **Passed:** A [test target][] meets all expectations
- **Failed:** A [test target][] does not meet all expectations
- **cantTell:** Whether the rule is applicable, or not all expectations were met could not be fully determined by the tester.
- **Untested**: The tester has not attempted to evaluate the test subject.

**Note**: A rule has one `passed` or `failed` outcome for every [test target][]. When a tester evaluates a test target it can also be reported as `cantTell` if the rule cannot be tested in its entirety. For example, when applicability was automated, but the expectations have to be evaluated manually.

When there are no test targets the rule has one `inapplicable` outcome. If the tester is unable to determine whether there are test targets there will be one `cantTell` outcome. And when no evaluation has occurred the test target has one untested outcome. This means that each [test subject][] always has one or more outcomes.

Outcomes used in ACT Rules can be expressed using the [outcome property][] of the [[EARL10-Schema]][].

### Programmatically Hidden {#programmatically-hidden}

An HTML element is _programmatically hidden_ if either it has a [computed][] CSS property `visibility` whose value is not `visible`; or at least one of the following is true for any of its [inclusive ancestors][] in the [flat tree][]:

- has a [computed][] CSS property `display` of `none`; or
- has an `aria-hidden` attribute set to `true`

**Note**: Contrary to the other conditions, the `visibility` CSS property may be reverted by descendants.

**Note**: The [HTML standard suggests](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/rendering.html#hidden-elements) setting the CSS `display` property to `none` for elements with the `hidden` attribute. While not required by HTML, all modern browsers follow this suggestion. Because of this the `hidden` attribute is not used in this definition. In browsers that use this suggestion, overriding the CSS `display` property can reveal elements with the `hidden` attribute.

### Visible {#visible}

Content perceivable through sight.

Content is considered _visible_ if making it fully transparent would result in a difference in the pixels rendered for any part of the document that is currently within the viewport or can be brought into the viewport via scrolling.

[Content is defined in WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-content).
