## Test Procedure

## Applicability

This rule applies to every [non-streaming](#non-streaming-media-element) `video` element that is [visible][], where the video contains audio.

## Expectation

For each test target, the [outcome](#outcome) of at least one of the following rules is passed:

- [`Video` Element Visual Content Has Audio Description](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/1ea59c/proposed/)
- [`Video` Element Visual Content Has Transcript](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/1a02b0/proposed/)
- [`Video` Element Content Is Media Alternative For Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/ab4d13/proposed/)

## Assumptions

- This rule assumes that a mechanism is available to start the video and that the video element is not simply used to display the [poster](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/semantics-embedded-content.html#element-attrdef-video-poster).
- This rule assumes that the language of each test target can be correctly determined (either programmatically or by analyzing the content), and sufficiently understood.

## Accessibility Support

The HTML `video` element can also have a `track` element that provides an audio description. This should provide assistive technologies with a timed text description of visual information in a video. However, there is no native support in any major browser for this technique. Technique [H96: Using the track element to provide audio descriptions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H96) can not be relied upon to conform to [1.2.3: Audio Description or Media Alternative (Prerecorded)][sc123].

### Secondary Requirements

This rule is related to the following accessibility requirements, but was 
not designed to test this requirements directly. These 
[secondary requirements](https://w3c.github.io/wcag-act/act-rules-format.html#secondary-requirements)
can either be stricter than the rule requires, or may be satisfied in ways 
not tested by the rule:

- [1.2.5 Audio Description (Prerecorded) (Level AA)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#audio-description-prerecorded): This success criterion is **more strict** than this rule. This is because the rule allows a media alternative in place of audio description. Some of the passed examples do not satisfy this success criterion.
- [1.2.8 Media Alternative (Prerecorded) (Level AAA)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#media-alternative-prerecorded): This success criterion is **more strict** than this rule. This is because the rule allows audio description in place of a media alternative. Some of the passed examples do not satisfy this success criterion.

## Input Rules

Outcomes of the following rules are required as input for this rule.

- [Video element visual content has audio description](/standards-guidelines/act/rules/video-audio-description-1ea59c/)
- [Audio and visuals of video element have transcript](/standards-guidelines/act/rules/video-transcript-1a02b0/)
- [Video element content is media alternative for text](/standards-guidelines/act/rules/video-as-media-alternative-ab4d13/)

## Glossary

### Non-streaming media element {#non-streaming-media-element}

A _non-streaming media element_ is an [HTML Media Element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#htmlmediaelement) for which the `duration` property is not 0.

### Outcome {#outcome}

An _outcome_ is a conclusion that comes from evaluating an ACT Rule on a [test subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-subject) or one of its constituent [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target). An outcome can be one of the three following types:

- **Inapplicable:** No part of the test subject matches the applicability
- **Passed:** A [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target) meets all expectations
- **Failed:** A [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target) does not meet all expectations

**Note:** A rule has one `passed` or `failed` outcome for every [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target). When there are no test targets the rule has one `inapplicable` outcome. This means that each [test subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-subject) will have one or more outcomes.

**Note:** Implementations using the [EARL10-Schema](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/) can express the outcome with the [outcome property](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/#outcome). In addition to `passed`, `failed` and `inapplicable`, EARL 1.0 also defined an `incomplete` outcome. While this cannot be the outcome of an ACT Rule when applied in its entirety, it often happens that rules are only partially evaluated. For example, when applicability was automated, but the expectations have to be evaluated manually. Such "interim" results can be expressed with the `incomplete` outcome.

### Visible {#visible}

Content perceivable through sight.

Content is considered _visible_ if making it fully transparent would result in a difference in the pixels rendered for any part of the document that is currently within the viewport or can be brought into the viewport via scrolling.

[Content is defined in WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-content).

For more details, see [examples of visible](https://act-rules.github.io/pages/examples/visible/).
