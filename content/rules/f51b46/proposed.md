    This rule checks that captions are available for audio information in non-streaming `video` elements.
  last_modified: 21 November 2024

## Applicability

This rule applies to every [non-streaming](#non-streaming-media-element) `video` element that is [visible][] where the video contains [audio](#audio-output) that is not only silence.

## Expectation

For each test target, audio information that is not conveyed visually in the video, is available through [captions](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-captions).

**Note:** Captions can be either embedded in the video file itself or can be made available trough a separate track.

## Background

### Assumptions

This rule assumes that the video element is used to play a video (for example, not only used to display an image), and that there is a mechanism to start the video.

### Accessibility Support

There are no accessibility support issues known.

### Secondary Requirements

This rule is related to the following accessibility requirements, but was 
not designed to test this requirements directly. These 
[secondary requirements](https://w3c.github.io/wcag-act/act-rules-format.html#secondary-requirements)
can either be stricter than the rule requires, or may be satisfied in ways 
not tested by the rule:

- [1.2.1 Audio-only and Video-only (Prerecorded) (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#audio-only-and-video-only-prerecorded): This success criterion is **less strict** than this rule. This is because the rule does not consider that the video may be a media alternative for text. Some of the failed examples satisfy this success criterion.

## Input Aspects

The following aspects are required in using this rule.

- [DOM Tree](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-aspects/#input-aspects-dom)
- [CSS Styling](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-aspects/#input-aspects-css)
- [Audio output](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-aspects/#input-aspects-audio-out)
- Visual output (no link available)

## Glossary

### Audio output {#audio-output}

This [test aspect](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#input-aspects) includes all auditory data output from the web page into an audio channel.

### Non-streaming media element {#non-streaming-media-element}

A _non-streaming media element_ is an [HTML Media Element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#htmlmediaelement) for which the `duration` property is not 0.

### Outcome {#outcome}

A conclusion that comes from evaluating an ACT Rule on a [test subject][] or one of its constituent test target. An outcome can be one of the five following types:

- **Inapplicable:** No part of the test subject matches the applicability
- **Passed:** A [test target][] meets all expectations
- **Failed:** A [test target][] does not meet all expectations
- **cantTell:** Whether the rule is applicable, or not all expectations were met could not be fully determined by the tester.
- **Untested**: The tester has not attempted to evaluate the test subject.

**Note**: A rule has one `passed` or `failed` outcome for every [test target][]. When a tester evaluates a test target it can also be reported as `cantTell` if the rule cannot be tested in its entirety. For example, when applicability was automated, but the expectations have to be evaluated manually.

When there are no test targets the rule has one `inapplicable` outcome. If the tester is unable to determine whether there are test targets there will be one `cantTell` outcome. And when no evaluation has occurred the test target has one untested outcome. This means that each [test subject][] always has one or more outcomes.

Outcomes used in ACT Rules can be expressed using the [outcome property][] of the [[EARL10-Schema]][].

### Visible {#visible}

Content perceivable through sight.

Content is considered _visible_ if making it fully transparent would result in a difference in the pixels rendered for any part of the document that is currently within the viewport or can be brought into the viewport via scrolling.

[Content is defined in WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-content).

For more details, see [examples of visible](https://act-rules.github.io/pages/examples/visible/).
