## Applicability

This rule applies to any `input` element with a `type` [attribute value][] of `image`, and that is [included in the accessibility tree][].

## Expectation

Each target element has an [accessible name][] that is neither empty (`""`), nor the default name for this element (localized version of "Submit Query").

## Assumptions

- This rule assumes that all image buttons are [user interface components as defined by WCAG 2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-user-interface-components).
- This rule assumes that the default name for image buttons ("Submit Query"), as defined by the [HTML Accessibility API Mapping][html aam image button], is never descriptive.

## Accessibility Support

There is a known combination of a popular browser and assistive technology that does not by default support `title` as an [accessible name][].

## Background

```

#### Passed Example 4

<a class="example-link" title="Passed Example 4" target="_blank" href="https://w3.org/WAI/content-assets/wcag-act-rules/testcases/59796f/7d97d6b2f3fa16760bf66026691281a8179f3260.html">Open in a new tab</a>

The image button has an [accessible name][] through the `aria-labelledby` attribute.

```html
<input type="image" src="/test-assets/shared/search-icon.svg" aria-labelledby="id1" />
<div id="id1">Search</div>
```

### Failed

#### Failed Example 1

<a class="example-link" title="Failed Example 1" target="_blank" href="https://w3.org/WAI/content-assets/wcag-act-rules/testcases/59796f/04342a3834e0003f3057807937d617e432e83d33.html">Open in a new tab</a>

The image button element has an [accessible name][] equal to the default "Submit Query". The `name` attribute can not be used to provide an [accessible name][].

```html
<input type="image" name="search" src="/test-assets/shared/search-icon.svg" />
```

#### Failed Example 2

<a class="example-link" title="Failed Example 2" target="_blank" href="https://w3.org/WAI/content-assets/wcag-act-rules/testcases/59796f/5c71cdabc04f9038e21d872e20a516cb429a7619.html">Open in a new tab</a>

The image button has an empty `alt` attribute, and no other attributes that can give it an [accessible name][], hence its name is the default "Submit Query".

```html
<input type="image" src="/test-assets/shared/search-icon.svg" alt="" />
```

#### Failed Example 3

<a class="example-link" title="Failed Example 3" target="_blank" href="https://w3.org/WAI/content-assets/wcag-act-rules/testcases/59796f/0bbd55ba8e418361f99f717418206a37d57fd978.html">Open in a new tab</a>

The image button has an `aria-labelledby` attribute, but the referenced element does not exist. This gives the button the default [accessible name][] of "Submit Query".

```html
<input type="image" src="/test-assets/shared/search-icon.svg" aria-labelledby="non-existing" />
```

### Inapplicable

#### Inapplicable Example 1

<a class="example-link" title="Inapplicable Example 1" target="_blank" href="https://w3.org/WAI/content-assets/wcag-act-rules/testcases/59796f/a4cc71b0434f71f4ea0069c409f73e0207dfb403.html">Open in a new tab</a>

The `button` element is not an image button. [Success Criterion 1.1.1 Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#non-text-content) can not fail text buttons. Only non-text content is applicable.

```html
<button>My button</button>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 2

<a class="example-link" title="Inapplicable Example 2" target="_blank" href="https://w3.org/WAI/content-assets/wcag-act-rules/testcases/59796f/37cce377c874eec22d1137977d2b8f00ebc42ea8.html">Open in a new tab</a>

The `input` element with the `type` [attribute value][] of `button` is not an image button. [Success Criterion 1.1.1 Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#non-text-content) can not fail text buttons. Only non-text content is applicable.

```html
<input type="button" value="My button" />
```

#### Inapplicable Example 3

<a class="example-link" title="Inapplicable Example 3" target="_blank" href="https://w3.org/WAI/content-assets/wcag-act-rules/testcases/59796f/9ceceeffee45fea0d16ce4d87d4c048f1a68ca93.html">Open in a new tab</a>

The `button` element is tested separately from the `img` element. [Success Criterion 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#name-role-value) is applied to the button, whereas the image is tested under [Success Criterion 1.1.1 Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#non-text-content)

```html
<button><img src="/test-assets/shared/search-icon.svg" alt="Search" /></button>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 4

<a class="example-link" title="Inapplicable Example 4" target="_blank" href="https://w3.org/WAI/content-assets/wcag-act-rules/testcases/59796f/ebd0080bacb8debc7ad069072240657df38c3e2c.html">Open in a new tab</a>

The `img` element is not a user interface component, and so is not tested for [Success Criterion 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#name-role-value).

```html
<img src="/test-assets/shared/w3c-logo.png" alt="W3C logo" />
```

#### Inapplicable Example 5

<a class="example-link" title="Inapplicable Example 5" target="_blank" href="https://w3.org/WAI/content-assets/wcag-act-rules/testcases/59796f/ba176379d78ef73bf17c7703ca6b512463227d13.html">Open in a new tab</a>

The image button is ignored by assistive technologies because it is not [included in the accessibility tree][]. These are not required to have an accessible name. If at some future state of the page the element gets [included in the accessibility tree][], an [accessible name][] will be necessary.

```html
<input type="image" src="/test-assets/shared/search-icon.svg" style="display: none;" />
```

## Glossary

### Accessible Name {#accessible-name}

The _accessible name_ is the programmatically determined name of a user interface element that is [included in the accessibility tree](#included-in-the-accessibility-tree).

The accessible name is calculated using the [accessible name and description computation][].

For native markup languages, such as HTML and SVG, additional information on how to calculate the accessible name can be found in [HTML Accessibility API Mappings 1.0, Accessible Name and Description Computation (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam/#accessible-name-and-description-computation) and [SVG Accessibility API Mappings, Name and Description (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg-aam/#mapping_additional).

For more details, see [examples of accessible name][].

**Note:** As per the [accessible name and description computation][], each element always has an accessible name. When no accessible name is provided, the element will nonetheless be assigned an empty (`""`) one.

**Note:** As per the [accessible name and description computation][], accessible names are [flat string](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.1/#terminology) trimmed of leading and trailing whitespace. Notably, it is not possible for a non-empty accessible name to be composed only of whitespace since these must be trimmed.

### Focusable {#focusable}

An element is _focusable_ if one or both of the following are true:

- the element is part of [sequential focus navigation][]; or
- the element has a [tabindex value][] that is not null.

**Exception**: Elements that lose focus during a period of up to 1 second after gaining focus, without the user interacting with the page the element is on, are not considered _focusable_.

Notes:

- The 1 second time span is an arbitrary limit which is not included in WCAG. Given that scripts can manage the focus state of elements, testing the focusability of an element consistently would be impractical without a time limit.
- The [tabindex value][] of an element is the value of the [tabindex attribute][] parsed using the [rules for parsing integers][]. For the [tabindex value][] to be different from null, it needs to be [parsed][rules for parsing integers] without errors.

### Included in the accessibility tree {#included-in-the-accessibility-tree}

Elements included in the accessibility tree of platform specific accessibility APIs are exposed to assistive technologies. This allows users of assistive technology to access the elements in a way that meets the requirements of the individual user.

The general rules for when elements are included in the accessibility tree are defined in the [core accessibility API mappings](https://www.w3.org/TR/core-aam/). For native markup languages, such as HTML and SVG, additional rules for when elements are included in the accessibility tree can be found in the [HTML accessibility API mappings (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam/) and the [SVG accessibility API mappings (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg-aam/).

For more details, see [examples of included in the accessibility tree][].

[Programmatically hidden](#programmatically-hidden) elements are removed from the accessibility tree. However, some browsers will leave [focusable](#focusable) elements with an `aria-hidden` attribute set to `true` in the accessibility tree. Because they are hidden, these elements are considered **not** included in the accessibility tree. This may cause confusion for users of assistive technologies because they may still be able to interact with these focusable elements using sequential keyboard navigation, even though the element should not be included in the accessibility tree.

### Outcome {#outcome}

An _outcome_ is a conclusion that comes from evaluating an ACT Rule on a [test subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-subject) or one of its constituent [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target). An outcome can be one of the three following types:

- **Inapplicable:** No part of the test subject matches the applicability
- **Passed:** A [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target) meets all expectations
- **Failed:** A [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target) does not meet all expectations

**Note:** A rule has one `passed` or `failed` outcome for every [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target). When there are no test targets the rule has one `inapplicable` outcome. This means that each [test subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-subject) will have one or more outcomes.

**Note:** Implementations using the [EARL10-Schema](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/) can express the outcome with the [outcome property](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/#outcome). In addition to `passed`, `failed` and `inapplicable`, EARL 1.0 also defined an `incomplete` outcome. While this cannot be the outcome of an ACT Rule when applied in its entirety, it often happens that rules are only partially evaluated. For example, when applicability was automated, but the expectations have to be evaluated manually. Such "interim" results can be expressed with the `incomplete` outcome.

### Programmatically Hidden {#programmatically-hidden}

An HTML element is _programmatically hidden_ if either it has a [computed][] CSS property `visibility` whose value is not `visible`; or at least one of the following is true for any of its [inclusive ancestors][] in the [flat tree][]:

- has a [computed][] CSS property `display` of `none`; or
- has an `aria-hidden` attribute set to `true`

**Note**: Contrary to the other conditions, the `visibility` CSS property may be reverted by descendants.

**Note**: The [HTML standard suggests](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/rendering.html#hidden-elements) setting the CSS `display` property to `none` for elements with the `hidden` attribute. While not required by HTML, all modern browsers follow this suggestion. Because of this the `hidden` attribute is not used in this definition. In browsers that use this suggestion, overriding the CSS `display` property can reveal elements with the `hidden` attribute.
