## Applicability

This rule applies to any [HTML element][] with a `lang` attribute for which all the following are true:

- <dfn id="off6ek:in-body">in body</dfn>: the element is an [inclusive descendant][] in the [flat tree][] of a `body` element; and
- <dfn id="off6ek:html">HTML</dfn>: the element is in a [document][] with a [content type][] of `text/html`; and
- <dfn id="off6ek:valid-lang">Valid language</dfn>: the element's `lang` [attribute value][] has a [known primary language tag][]; and
- <dfn id="off6ek:not-empty">Not empty</dfn>: there is some non-empty [text inheriting its programmatic language][] from the element which is neither empty nor only [whitespace][].

## Expectation

For each test target, the [primary language][] of its `lang` [attribute value][] is a [most common language][] of the test target.

## Assumptions

- This rule assumes that user agents and assistive technologies can programmatically determine [known primary language tags][known primary language tag] even on [language tags][rfc 5646] that do not conform to the [RFC 5646][] syntax.

- This rule assumes that only [language tags][rfc 5646] with a [known primary language tag][] are enough to satisfy [Success Criterion 3.1.2 Language of Parts][sc312]; this notably excludes [grandfathered tags][] and [ISO 639.2][] three-letters codes, both having poor support in assistive technologies.

- This rule assumes that the text nodes contain text that express something in [human language][] and therefore need a correct programmatic language.

## Accessibility Support

_There are no major accessibility support issues known for this rule._

## Background

This rule checks that, if a `lang` attribute is used, its value is correct with respect to the content. This rule does not check whether a `lang` attribute should have been used or not. Especially, this rule does not check when `lang` attributes are missing. This must be tested separately and it is therefore possible to pass this rule without satisfying [Success Criterion 3.1.2 Language of Parts](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#language-of-parts).

- [The `lang` and `xml:lang` attributes](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#the-lang-and-xml:lang-attributes)

In all examples, the `html` element has itself a `lang` attribute in order to make sure that the examples satisfy [Success Criterion 3.1.1 Language of Page](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#language-of-page). These `html` elements are, however, never applicable because they are not descendants of a `body` element, and the example descriptions do not mention them further.

This `span` element has a `lang` [attribute value][] of `nl` (Dutch), which matches its [most common language][]. The most common language is Dutch because all words are Dutch.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<title>Dutch idioms</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<p>
			The Dutch phrase <span lang="nl">"Hij ging met de kippen op stok"</span> literally translates into "He went to
			roost with the chickens", but it means that he went to bed early.
		</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 2

<a class="example-link" title="Passed Example 2" href="https://w3.org/WAI/content-assets/wcag-act-rules/testcases/off6ek/df9260fddb4d08ca0669bea363828d089b36317b.html">Open in a new tab</a>

The second `p` element has `lang` attribute value of `nl` (Dutch), which matches its [most common language][]. The most common language is Dutch because all English words are in `span` elements with a `lang` attribute value of `en`. Both `span` elements also have a `lang` attribute matching their most common language.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<title>Dutch idioms</title>

This `div` element has a `lang` [attribute value][] of `en` (English), which matches its [most common language][]. The most common language is English because the accessible texts are English, and all other text is in a `p` element with a (correct) `lang` attribute value of `fr`.

```html
<html lang="FR">
	<head>
		<title>Feu d'artifice du nouvel an</title>
	</head>

This `span` element has a `lang` [attribute value][] of `fr` (French), which matches one of its [most common languages][most common language]. The most common languages are both English and French because all the words belong to both languages.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<p>
		Even though all its words are English and it has meaning in English, the sentence
		<span lang="fr">Paul put dire comment on tape</span> is also a French sentence.
	</p>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 5

<a class="example-link" title="Passed Example 5" href="https://w3.org/WAI/content-assets/wcag-act-rules/testcases/off6ek/61c507e0aab456cce20538400fc1067be37953a0.html">Open in a new tab</a>

This `span` element has a `lang` [attribute value][] of `en` (English), which matches one of its [most common languages][most common language]. The most common languages are both English and French because all the words belong to both languages.

```html
<html lang="fr">
	<p>
		Bien que tous les ses mots soient français et qu'elle ait un sens en français, la phrase
		<span lang="en">Paul put dire comment on tape</span> est aussi une phrase anglaise.

```

### Failed

#### Failed Example 1

This `span` element has `lang` attribute value of `fr` (French), which does not match its [most common language][]. The most common language is Dutch because all words are Dutch.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<title>Dutch idioms</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<p>
			The Dutch phrase <span lang="fr">"Hij ging met de kippen op stok"</span> literally translates into "He went to

The second `p` element has `lang` attribute value of `en` (English), which does not match its [most common language][]. The most common language is Dutch because all English words are in `span` elements with a `lang` attribute value of `fr`. Both `span` elements also have an incorrect `lang` attribute in order to make sure that all targets in this example fail the rule.

```html
<html lang="nl">
	<head>
		<title>Met de kippen op stok</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<blockquote>

This `div` element has a `lang` attribute value of `fr` (French), which does not match its [most common language][]. The most common language is English because the accessible texts are English, and all other text is in a `p` element with a `lang` attribute value of `nl`, which also doesn't match its common language.

```html
<html lang="fr">
	<head>

This `div` element has a `lang` attribute value of `fr` (French), which does not match its [most common language][]. The most common language is English because the accessible name of the `img` element is English. The `lang` attribute on the `p` element is effectively ignored. The `p` element is not applicable because there is no [text inheriting its programmatic language][] from it since its content is neither [visible][] nor [included in the accessibility tree][].

## Glossary

### Accessible Name {#accessible-name}

The _accessible name_ is the programmatically determined name of a user interface element that is [included in the accessibility tree](#included-in-the-accessibility-tree).

The accessible name is calculated using the [accessible name and description computation][].

For native markup languages, such as HTML and SVG, additional information on how to calculate the accessible name can be found in [HTML Accessibility API Mappings 1.0, Accessible Name and Description Computation (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam/#accessible-name-and-description-computation) and [SVG Accessibility API Mappings, Name and Description (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg-aam/#mapping_additional).

For more details, see [examples of accessible name][].

**Note:** As per the [accessible name and description computation][], each element always has an accessible name. When no accessible name is provided, the element will nonetheless be assigned an empty (`""`) one.

**Note:** As per the [accessible name and description computation][], accessible names are [flat string](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.1/#terminology) trimmed of leading and trailing whitespace. Notably, it is not possible for a non-empty accessible name to be composed only of whitespace since these must be trimmed.

### Attribute value {#attribute-value}

The <dfn id="attribute-value:attribute">attribute value</dfn> of a content attribute set on an HTML element is the value that the attribute gets after being parsed and computed according to specifications. It may differ from the value that is actually written in the HTML code due to trimming whitespace or non-digits characters, default values, or case-insensitivity.

Some notable case of attribute value, among others:

- For [enumerated attributes][], the <dfn id="attribute-value:enumerated">attribute value</dfn> is either the state of the attribute, or the keyword that maps to it; even for the default states. Thus `<input type="image" />` has an attribute value of either `Image Button` (the state) or `image` (the keyword mapping to it), both formulations having the same meaning; similarly, "an input element with a `type` _attribute value_ of `Text`" can be either `<input type="text" />`, `<input />` (missing value default), or `<input type="invalid" />` (invalid value default).
- For [boolean attributes][], the <dfn id="attribute-value:boolean">attribute value</dfn> is `true` when the attribute is present and `false` otherwise. Thus `<button disabled>`, `<button disabled="disabled">` and `<button disabled="">` all have a `disabled` _attribute value_ of `true`.
- For attributes whose value is used in a case-insensitive context, the <dfn id="attribute-value:case-insensitive">attribute value</dfn> is the lowercase version of the value written in the HTML code.
- For attributes that accept [numbers][], the <dfn id="attribute-value:number">attribute value</dfn> is the result of parsing the value written in the HTML code according to the rules for parsing this kind of number.
- For attributes that accept sets of tokens, whether [space separated][] or [comma separated][], the <dfn id="attribute-value:tokens-list">attribute value</dfn> is the set of tokens obtained after parsing the set and, depending on the case, converting its items to lowercase (if the set is used in a case-insensitive context).
- For `aria-*` attributes, the <dfn id="attribute-value:aria">attribute value</dfn> is computed as indicated in the [WAI-ARIA specification][] and the [HTML Accessibility API Mappings][html aam].

This list is not exhaustive, and only serves as an illustration for some of the most common cases.

The <dfn id="attribute-value:idl">attribute value</dfn> of an [IDL attribute][] is the value returned on getting it. Note that when an [IDL attribute][] [reflects][reflect] a content attribute, they have the same attribute value.

### Focusable {#focusable}

An element is _focusable_ if one or both of the following are true:

- the element is part of [sequential focus navigation][]; or
- the element has a [tabindex value][] that is not null.

**Exception**: Elements that lose focus during a period of up to 1 second after gaining focus, without the user interacting with the page the element is on, are not considered _focusable_.

Notes:

- The 1 second time span is an arbitrary limit which is not included in WCAG. Given that scripts can manage the focus state of elements, testing the focusability of an element consistently would be impractical without a time limit.
- The [tabindex value][] of an element is the value of the [tabindex attribute][] parsed using the [rules for parsing integers][]. For the [tabindex value][] to be different from null, it needs to be [parsed][rules for parsing integers] without errors.

### Included in the accessibility tree {#included-in-the-accessibility-tree}

Elements included in the accessibility tree of platform specific accessibility APIs are exposed to assistive technologies. This allows users of assistive technology to access the elements in a way that meets the requirements of the individual user.

The general rules for when elements are included in the accessibility tree are defined in the [core accessibility API mappings](https://www.w3.org/TR/core-aam/). For native markup languages, such as HTML and SVG, additional rules for when elements are included in the accessibility tree can be found in the [HTML accessibility API mappings (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam/) and the [SVG accessibility API mappings (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg-aam/).

For more details, see [examples of included in the accessibility tree][].

[Programmatically hidden](#programmatically-hidden) elements are removed from the accessibility tree. However, some browsers will leave [focusable](#focusable) elements with an `aria-hidden` attribute set to `true` in the accessibility tree. Because they are hidden, these elements are considered **not** included in the accessibility tree. This may cause confusion for users of assistive technologies because they may still be able to interact with these focusable elements using sequential keyboard navigation, even though the element should not be included in the accessibility tree.

### Known Primary Language Tag {#known-primary-language-tag}

A language tag has a _known primary language tag_ if its [primary language subtag][] exists in the [language subtag registry][] with a [Type field][] whose field-body value is `language`.

A "language tag" is here to be understood as in the first paragraph of the [RFC 5646 language tag syntax][language tag], i.e. a sequence of subtags separated by hyphens, where a subtag is any sequence of alphanumerical characters. [Language tag][] that are not valid according to the stricter [RFC 5646 syntax][language tag] (and ABNF grammar) definition can still have a known primary language tag. User agents and assistive technologies are more lenient in what they accept. This definition is consistent with the behavior of the `:lang()` pseudo-selector as defined by [Selectors Level 3][].

As an example, `de-hello` would be an accepted way to indicate German in current user agents and assistive technologies, despite not being valid according to [RFC 5646 grammar][language tag]. It has a known primary language tag (namely, `de`).

As a consequence of this definition, however, [grandfathered tags][] do not have a known primary language tag.

Subtags, notably the [primary language subtag][], are [case insensitive][]. Comparison with the [language subtag registry][] must be done in a case insensitive way.

### Most Common Language of an Element {#most-common-element-language}

The _most common language of an element_ is determined by counting the number of _words_ in the [text inheriting its programmatic language][] from this element that are part of any of the languages in the [language subtag registry][]. The same word can be part of multiple languages. In case of ties, the element has several most common languages. If there are no words in the [text inheriting its programmatic language][] from the element, then it has no most common language.

For more details, see [examples of most common language][].

### Namespaced Element {#namespaced-element}

An [element][] with a specific [namespaceURI][] value from [HTML namespaces][]. For example an "SVG element" is any element with the "SVG namespace", which is `http://www.w3.org/2000/svg`.

Namespaced elements are not limited to elements described in a specification. They also include custom elements. Elements such as `a` and `title` have a different namespace depending on where they are used. For example a `title` in an HTML page usually has the HTML namespace. When used in an `svg` element, a `title` element has the SVG namespace instead.

### Outcome {#outcome}

An _outcome_ is a conclusion that comes from evaluating an ACT Rule on a [test subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-subject) or one of its constituent [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target). An outcome can be one of the three following types:

- **Inapplicable:** No part of the test subject matches the applicability
- **Passed:** A [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target) meets all expectations
- **Failed:** A [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target) does not meet all expectations

**Note:** A rule has one `passed` or `failed` outcome for every [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target). When there are no test targets the rule has one `inapplicable` outcome. This means that each [test subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-subject) will have one or more outcomes.

**Note:** Implementations using the [EARL10-Schema](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/) can express the outcome with the [outcome property](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/#outcome). In addition to `passed`, `failed` and `inapplicable`, EARL 1.0 also defined an `incomplete` outcome. While this cannot be the outcome of an ACT Rule when applied in its entirety, it often happens that rules are only partially evaluated. For example, when applicability was automated, but the expectations have to be evaluated manually. Such "interim" results can be expressed with the `incomplete` outcome.

### Programmatically Hidden {#programmatically-hidden}

An HTML element is _programmatically hidden_ if either it has a [computed][] CSS property `visibility` whose value is not `visible`; or at least one of the following is true for any of its [inclusive ancestors][] in the [flat tree][]:

- has a [computed][] CSS property `display` of `none`; or
- has an `aria-hidden` attribute set to `true`

**Note**: Contrary to the other conditions, the `visibility` CSS property may be reverted by descendants.

**Note**: The [HTML standard suggests](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/rendering.html#hidden-elements) setting the CSS `display` property to `none` for elements with the `hidden` attribute. While not required by HTML, all modern browsers follow this suggestion. Because of this the `hidden` attribute is not used in this definition. In browsers that use this suggestion, overriding the CSS `display` property can reveal elements with the `hidden` attribute.

### Text Inheriting its Programmatic Language from an Element {#text-inheriting-language}

The <dfn id="text-inheriting-language:text">text inheriting its programmatic language</dfn> from an element E is composed of all the following texts:

- **text nodes**: the value of any [text nodes][] that are [visible][] or [included in the accessibility tree][] and children of an element inheriting its programmatic language from E;
- **accessible text**: the [accessible name][] and [accessible description][] of any [element inheriting its programmatic language](#text-inheriting-language:element) from E, and [included in the accessibility tree][];
- **page title**: the value of the [document title][], only if E is a [document][] in a [top-level browsing context][].

An element F is an <dfn id="text-inheriting-language:element">element inheriting its programmatic language</dfn> from an element E if at least one of the following conditions is true (recursively):

- F is E itself (an element always inherits its programmatic language from itself); or
- F does not have a non-empty `lang` attribute, and is the child in the [flat tree][] of an element inheriting its programmatic language from E; or
- F is a [fully active][] [document][] element, has no non-empty `lang` attribute, and its [browsing context container][] is an element inheriting its programmatic language from E.

### Visible {#visible}

Content perceivable through sight.

Content is considered _visible_ if making it fully transparent would result in a difference in the pixels rendered for any part of the document that is currently within the viewport or can be brought into the viewport via scrolling.

[Content is defined in WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-content).

For more details, see [examples of visible](https://act-rules.github.io/pages/examples/visible/).

### Whitespace {#whitespace}

_Whitespace_ are characters that have the Unicode "White_Space" property in the [Unicode properties list](https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/PropList.txt).

This includes:

- all characters in the [Unicode Separator categories](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode11.0.0/ch04.pdf#G134153), and
- the following characters in the [Other, Control](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode11.0.0/ch04.pdf#G134153) category:

  - Character tabulation (U+0009)
  - Line Feed (LF) (U+000A)
  - Line Tabulation (U+000B)
  - Form Feed (FF) (U+000C)
  - Carriage Return (CR) (U+000D)
  - Next Line (NEL) (U+0085)
