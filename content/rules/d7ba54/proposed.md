    Non-streaming `video` elements without audio must have an audio alternative.

## Applicability

This rule applies to any [non-streaming](#non-streaming-media-element) `video` element that is [visible][] where the video does not contain audio.

## Expectation

The visual information of each test target is available through an audio track.

## Background

### Assumptions

This rule assumes that a mechanism is available to start the video and that the video element is not simply used to display the [poster](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/semantics-embedded-content.html#element-attrdef-video-poster).

### Accessibility Support

There are no accessibility support issues known.

## Test Cases

### Passed

#### Passed Example 1

<a class="example-link" title="Passed Example 1" target="_blank" href="https://w3.org/WAI/content-assets/wcag-act-rules/testcases/d7ba54/634bb07611c5d126e49caf4bfce8b6d50c872fce.html">Open in a new tab</a>

This `video` element, which has no audio, has a separate audio track that describes the visual information.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<video controls>
		<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/silent.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
		<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/silent.webm" type="video/webm" />
	</video>

	<audio controls>
		<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/audio-description.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
	</audio>
</html>
```

### Failed

This `video` element, which has no audio, does not have an audio track describing the visual information.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<video controls>
		<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/silent.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
		<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/silent.webm" type="video/webm" />

This `video` element, which has no audio, has a separate audio track that incorrectly describes the visual information.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<video controls>
		<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/silent.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
		<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/silent.webm" type="video/webm" />

## Glossary

### Non-streaming media element {#non-streaming-media-element}

A _non-streaming media element_ is an [HTML Media Element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#htmlmediaelement) for which the `duration` property is not 0.

### Outcome {#outcome}

A conclusion that comes from evaluating an ACT Rule on a [test subject][] or one of its constituent test target. An outcome can be one of the five following types:

- **Inapplicable:** No part of the test subject matches the applicability
- **Passed:** A [test target][] meets all expectations
- **Failed:** A [test target][] does not meet all expectations
- **cantTell:** Whether the rule is applicable, or not all expectations were met could not be fully determined by the tester.
- **Untested**: The tester has not attempted to evaluate the test subject.

**Note**: A rule has one `passed` or `failed` outcome for every [test target][]. When a tester evaluates a test target it can also be reported as `cantTell` if the rule cannot be tested in its entirety. For example, when applicability was automated, but the expectations have to be evaluated manually.

When there are no test targets the rule has one `inapplicable` outcome. If the tester is unable to determine whether there are test targets there will be one `cantTell` outcome. And when no evaluation has occurred the test target has one untested outcome. This means that each [test subject][] always has one or more outcomes.

Outcomes used in ACT Rules can be expressed using the [outcome property][] of the [[EARL10-Schema]][].

### Visible {#visible}

Content perceivable through sight.

Content is considered _visible_ if making it fully transparent would result in a difference in the pixels rendered for any part of the document that is currently within the viewport or can be brought into the viewport via scrolling.

[Content is defined in WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-content).

For more details, see [examples of visible](https://act-rules.github.io/pages/examples/visible/).
