## Applicability

This rule applies to any element with an `aria-hidden` [attribute value][] of `true`.

## Expectation

None of the target elements has an [inclusive descendant][] in the [flat tree][] that are [focusable][] and part of the [sequential focus navigation][].

## Assumptions

Interacting with the page does not result in changing the `aria-hidden` [attribute value][] of target elements. An example of such a situation would be when closing a modal dialog makes previously hidden elements that were not [focusable][] or part of the [sequential focus navigation][] become [focusable][] and part of the [sequential focus navigation][].

## Accessibility Support

Some user agents treat the value of `aria-hidden` attribute as case-sensitive.

## Background

Using `aria-hidden="false"` on a descendant of an element with `aria-hidden="true"` [**does not** expose that element](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-hidden). `aria-hidden="true"` hides itself and all its content from assistive technologies.

By adding `aria-hidden="true"` to an element, content authors ensure that assistive technologies will ignore the element. This can be used to hide parts of a web page that are [pure decoration](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-pure-decoration), such as icon fonts - that are not meant to be read by assistive technologies.

An element with an `aria-hidden` attribute set to `true` that is also part of the [sequential focus navigation][] may cause confusion for users of assistive technologies because the element can be reached via [sequential focus navigation][], but it should be hidden and not [included in the accessibility tree][].

The 1 second time span introduced in the exception of the definition of [focusable][] is an arbitrary limit which is not included in WCAG. Given that scripts can manage the focus state of elements, testing the focused state of an element consistently would be impractical without a time limit.

#### Passed Example 4

<a class="example-link" title="Passed Example 4" target="_blank" href="https://w3.org/WAI/content-assets/wcag-act-rules/testcases/6cfa84/d343bc6a2877b62d80153453c3781debc33e0b1d.html">Open in a new tab</a>

This `a` element is not [focusable][] because it moves focus to the `input` element whenever it receives focus. These elements
are sometimes referred to as 'focus sentinel' or 'bumper'. They are typically found before and after a modal / dialog in
order to contain focus within the modal. Page authors do not want the sentinel to be visible, nor do they want them to be read by
a screen reader. But, they do want the element to be part of the [sequential focus navigation][]. This allows the page author
to detect that focus has left the dialog in order to wrap it to the top/bottom as appropriate.

```html
<div
	id="sampleModal"
	role="dialog"
	aria-label="Sample Modal"
	aria-modal="true"
	style="border: solid black 1px; padding: 1rem;"
>
	<label>First and last name <input id="dialogFirst"/></label><br />
	<button id="closeButton">Close button</button>
</div>
<div aria-hidden="true">
	<a href="#" id="sentinelAfter" style="position:absolute; top:-999em"
		>Upon receiving focus, this focus sentinel should wrap focus to the top of the modal</a
	>
</div>
<script>
	document.getElementById('sentinelAfter').addEventListener('focus', () => {
		document.getElementById('dialogFirst').focus()
	})
	document.getElementById('closeButton').addEventListener('click', () => {
		document.getElementById('sampleModal').style.display = 'none'
	})
</script>
```

This `button` element is [focusable][], but not part of the [sequential focus navigation][] because of the `tabindex` attribute.

```html
<div aria-hidden="true">

</div>
```

#### Passed Example 6

This `svg` element with `aria-hidden` does not have a focusable descendant, focusable ancestors are not a problem for this rule.

```html
<a href="#">

#### Failed Example 3

<a class="example-link" title="Failed Example 3" target="_blank" href="https://w3.org/WAI/content-assets/wcag-act-rules/testcases/6cfa84/7d1d269e9ff9a8f396b2d638103379b6cf937225.html">Open in a new tab</a>

This `button` element is part of the [sequential focus navigation][] and a descendant of an element with an `aria-hidden` [attribute value][] of `true` because `aria-hidden` can't be reset once set to true on an ancestor.

```html
<div aria-hidden="true">
	<div aria-hidden="false">
		<button>Some button</button>
	</div>
</div>
```

#### Failed Example 4

```html
<details aria-hidden="true">
	<summary>Some button</summary>
	<p>Some details</p>
</details>
```

#### Failed Example 6

<a class="example-link" title="Failed Example 6" target="_blank" href="https://w3.org/WAI/content-assets/wcag-act-rules/testcases/6cfa84/9812d828fef2da32081f4c0acce0c58912f071cb.html">Open in a new tab</a>

This `a` element is [focusable][] because it fails to move focus when it receives focus. This is in contrast to a focus sentinel that
immediately jumps focus to a valid location. Focus sentinels are typically used before and after a modal dialog in order to contain
and wrap focus. In this case, the `focus` event was removed, but the sentinel was not.

```html
<div
	id="sampleModal"
	role="dialog"
	aria-label="Sample Modal"
	aria-modal="true"
	style="border: solid black 1px; padding: 1rem;"
>
	<label>First and last name <input id="dialogFirst"/></label><br />
	<button id="closeButton">Close button</button>
</div>
<div aria-hidden="true">
	<a href="#" id="sentinelAfter" style="position:absolute; top:-999em"
		>Upon receiving focus, this focus sentinel should wrap focus to the top of the modal</a
	>
</div>
<script>
	document.getElementById('closeButton').addEventListener('click', () => {
		document.getElementById('sampleModal').style.display = 'none'
	})
</script>
```

## Glossary

### Attribute value {#attribute-value}

The <dfn id="attribute-value:attribute">attribute value</dfn> of a content attribute set on an HTML element is the value that the attribute gets after being parsed and computed according to specifications. It may differ from the value that is actually written in the HTML code due to trimming whitespace or non-digits characters, default values, or case-insensitivity.

Some notable case of attribute value, among others:

- For [enumerated attributes][], the <dfn id="attribute-value:enumerated">attribute value</dfn> is either the state of the attribute, or the keyword that maps to it; even for the default states. Thus `<input type="image" />` has an attribute value of either `Image Button` (the state) or `image` (the keyword mapping to it), both formulations having the same meaning; similarly, "an input element with a `type` _attribute value_ of `Text`" can be either `<input type="text" />`, `<input />` (missing value default), or `<input type="invalid" />` (invalid value default).
- For [boolean attributes][], the <dfn id="attribute-value:boolean">attribute value</dfn> is `true` when the attribute is present and `false` otherwise. Thus `<button disabled>`, `<button disabled="disabled">` and `<button disabled="">` all have a `disabled` _attribute value_ of `true`.
- For attributes whose value is used in a case-insensitive context, the <dfn id="attribute-value:case-insensitive">attribute value</dfn> is the lowercase version of the value written in the HTML code.
- For attributes that accept [numbers][], the <dfn id="attribute-value:number">attribute value</dfn> is the result of parsing the value written in the HTML code according to the rules for parsing this kind of number.
- For attributes that accept sets of tokens, whether [space separated][] or [comma separated][], the <dfn id="attribute-value:tokens-list">attribute value</dfn> is the set of tokens obtained after parsing the set and, depending on the case, converting its items to lowercase (if the set is used in a case-insensitive context).
- For `aria-*` attributes, the <dfn id="attribute-value:aria">attribute value</dfn> is computed as indicated in the [WAI-ARIA specification][] and the [HTML Accessibility API Mappings][html aam].

This list is not exhaustive, and only serves as an illustration for some of the most common cases.

The <dfn id="attribute-value:idl">attribute value</dfn> of an [IDL attribute][] is the value returned on getting it. Note that when an [IDL attribute][] [reflects][reflect] a content attribute, they have the same attribute value.

### Focusable {#focusable}

An element is _focusable_ if one or both of the following are true:

- the element is part of [sequential focus navigation][]; or
- the element has a [tabindex value][] that is not null.

**Exception**: Elements that lose focus during a period of up to 1 second after gaining focus, without the user interacting with the page the element is on, are not considered _focusable_.

Notes:

- The 1 second time span is an arbitrary limit which is not included in WCAG. Given that scripts can manage the focus state of elements, testing the focusability of an element consistently would be impractical without a time limit.
- The [tabindex value][] of an element is the value of the [tabindex attribute][] parsed using the [rules for parsing integers][]. For the [tabindex value][] to be different from null, it needs to be [parsed][rules for parsing integers] without errors.

### Included in the accessibility tree {#included-in-the-accessibility-tree}

Elements included in the accessibility tree of platform specific accessibility APIs are exposed to assistive technologies. This allows users of assistive technology to access the elements in a way that meets the requirements of the individual user.

The general rules for when elements are included in the accessibility tree are defined in the [core accessibility API mappings](https://www.w3.org/TR/core-aam/). For native markup languages, such as HTML and SVG, additional rules for when elements are included in the accessibility tree can be found in the [HTML accessibility API mappings (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam/) and the [SVG accessibility API mappings (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg-aam/).

For more details, see [examples of included in the accessibility tree][].

[Programmatically hidden](#programmatically-hidden) elements are removed from the accessibility tree. However, some browsers will leave [focusable](#focusable) elements with an `aria-hidden` attribute set to `true` in the accessibility tree. Because they are hidden, these elements are considered **not** included in the accessibility tree. This may cause confusion for users of assistive technologies because they may still be able to interact with these focusable elements using sequential keyboard navigation, even though the element should not be included in the accessibility tree.

### Outcome {#outcome}

An _outcome_ is a conclusion that comes from evaluating an ACT Rule on a [test subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-subject) or one of its constituent [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target). An outcome can be one of the three following types:

- **Inapplicable:** No part of the test subject matches the applicability
- **Passed:** A [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target) meets all expectations
- **Failed:** A [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target) does not meet all expectations

**Note:** A rule has one `passed` or `failed` outcome for every [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target). When there are no test targets the rule has one `inapplicable` outcome. This means that each [test subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-subject) will have one or more outcomes.

**Note:** Implementations using the [EARL10-Schema](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/) can express the outcome with the [outcome property](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/#outcome). In addition to `passed`, `failed` and `inapplicable`, EARL 1.0 also defined an `incomplete` outcome. While this cannot be the outcome of an ACT Rule when applied in its entirety, it often happens that rules are only partially evaluated. For example, when applicability was automated, but the expectations have to be evaluated manually. Such "interim" results can be expressed with the `incomplete` outcome.

### Programmatically Hidden {#programmatically-hidden}

An HTML element is _programmatically hidden_ if either it has a [computed][] CSS property `visibility` whose value is not `visible`; or at least one of the following is true for any of its [inclusive ancestors][] in the [flat tree][]:

- has a [computed][] CSS property `display` of `none`; or
- has an `aria-hidden` attribute set to `true`

**Note**: Contrary to the other conditions, the `visibility` CSS property may be reverted by descendants.

**Note**: The [HTML standard suggests](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/rendering.html#hidden-elements) setting the CSS `display` property to `none` for elements with the `hidden` attribute. While not required by HTML, all modern browsers follow this suggestion. Because of this the `hidden` attribute is not used in this definition. In browsers that use this suggestion, overriding the CSS `display` property can reveal elements with the `hidden` attribute.
