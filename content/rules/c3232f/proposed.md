## Applicability

This rule applies to any [non-streaming](#non-streaming-media-element) `video` element that is [visible][] where the video does not contain audio.

## Expectation

For each test target, the [outcome](#outcome) of at least one of the following rules is passed:

- [`Video` Element Visual-Only Content Is Media Alternative For Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/fd26cf/)
- [`Video` Element Visual-Only Content Has Transcript](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/ee13b5/)
- [`Video` Element Visual-Only Content Has Audio Track Alternative](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/d7ba54/)

## Background

### Assumptions

- A mechanism is available to start the video and the video element is not simply used to display the [poster](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#attr-video-poster).
- The language of each test target can be correctly determined (either programmatically or by analyzing the content), and sufficiently understood.

### Accessibility Support

The HTML `video` element can also have a `track` element that provides an audio description. This should provide assistive technologies with a timed text description of visual information in a video. However, there is no native support in any major browser for this technique. Technique [H96: Using the track element to provide audio descriptions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/html/H96) can not be relied upon to conform to [1.2.1: Audio-only and Video-only (Prerecorded)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#audio-only-and-video-only-prerecorded).

This `video` element, which has no audio, has a separate audio track that describes the visual information. Thus, it passes rule [`Video` Element Visual-Only Content Has Audio Track Alternative](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/d7ba54/).

This `video` element, which has no audio, is a media alternative for the text in the page and labeled as such. Thus, it passes rule [`Video` Element Visual-Only Content Is Media Alternative For Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/fd26cf/).

## Glossary

### Non-streaming media element {#non-streaming-media-element}

A _non-streaming media element_ is an [HTML Media Element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#htmlmediaelement) for which the `duration` property is not 0.

### Outcome {#outcome}

A conclusion that comes from evaluating an ACT Rule on a [test subject][] or one of its constituent test target. An outcome can be one of the five following types:

- **Inapplicable:** No part of the test subject matches the applicability
- **Passed:** A [test target][] meets all expectations
- **Failed:** A [test target][] does not meet all expectations
- **cantTell:** Whether the rule is applicable, or not all expectations were met could not be fully determined by the tester.
- **Untested**: The tester has not attempted to evaluate the test subject.

**Note**: A rule has one `passed` or `failed` outcome for every [test target][]. When a tester evaluates a test target it can also be reported as `cantTell` if the rule cannot be tested in its entirety. For example, when applicability was automated, but the expectations have to be evaluated manually.

When there are no test targets the rule has one `inapplicable` outcome. If the tester is unable to determine whether there are test targets there will be one `cantTell` outcome. And when no evaluation has occurred the test target has one untested outcome. This means that each [test subject][] always has one or more outcomes.

Outcomes used in ACT Rules can be expressed using the [outcome property][] of the [[EARL10-Schema]][].

### Visible {#visible}

Content perceivable through sight.

Content is considered _visible_ if making it fully transparent would result in a difference in the pixels rendered for any part of the document that is currently within the viewport or can be brought into the viewport via scrolling.

[Content is defined in WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-content).

For more details, see [examples of visible](https://act-rules.github.io/pages/examples/visible/).
