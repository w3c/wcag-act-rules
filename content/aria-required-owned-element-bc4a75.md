## Applicability

This rule applies to any [HTML or SVG element][] that is [included in the accessibility tree][] and has a [WAI-ARIA 1.1][] [explicit semantic role][] with [required owned elements][], except if one or more of the following is true:

- the element is a [semantic][semantic role] `combobox`; or
- the element has the `aria-busy` [attribute value][] of `true`, or has an [ancestor][] in the accessibility tree with this [attribute value][].

## Expectation

Each test target only [owns][] elements with a [semantic role][] from the [required owned element][] list for the test target's [semantic role]().

**Note:** The definition of [owned by][] used in this rule is different than the definition of ["owned element" in WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#dfn-owned-element). See more in the [owned by][] definition.

## Assumptions

If the [explicit semantic role][] on the target element is incorrectly used, and any relationships between elements are already programmatically determinable, failing this rule may not result in accessibility issues for users of assistive technologies, and it should then not be considered a failure under [WCAG success criterion 1.3.1 Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#info-and-relationships).

## Accessibility Support

- User agents do not all have the same accessibility tree. Particularly the method of deriving which element owns which other elements varies between browsers. This can lead to different results for this rule, depending on which accessibility tree is used as input.
- `aria-owns` has limited support in some user agents.
- Assistive technologies are not consistent in how they handle situations where a [required owned element][] has a missing or incorrect role. This can lead to situations where inaccurate owned elements behave as expected in one assistive technology, but not in another.
- Some user agents treat the value of `aria-busy` as case-sensitive.

## Background

Some [required owned elements][] are only valid if they themselves [own][owns] (or "contain") elements with a given [semantic role][]. This is denoted by an arrow (meaning "containing") in the role description. For example, the role `menu` has `group â†’ menuitemradio` as one of its [required owned elements][], meaning that elements with a role of `menu` may only [own][owns] elements with a role of `group` who themselves only [own][owns] elements with a role of `menuitemradio`.

The applicability of this rule is limited to the [WAI-ARIA 1.1 Recommendation][wai-aria 1.1] roles. The [WAI-ARIA Graphics Module][] does not include any [required owned elements][]. The [Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module (DPUB ARIA) 1.0][dpub 1.0] only has three roles with [required owned elements][] (`doc-bibliography`, `doc-endnotes` and `doc-glossary`); they have issues with their use of role inheritance, and all of them have no [required owned elements][] in the [Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module (DPUB ARIA) 1.1][dpub 1.1] editor's draft.

The combobox role is excluded from this rule, because the design pattern for it as described in ARIA 1.1 has proven problematic. The combobox will be significantly different for ARIA 1.2, where it does not have [required owned elements][].

**Note:** [Subclass roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#subclassroles) of [required owned elements][] are not automatically included as possible [required owned elements][]. For example, the `treeitem` role is not a [required owned elements][] for [`list`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#list), even though `treeitem` is a [subclass role](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#subclassroles) of `listitem`.

## Test Cases

### Passed

#### Passed Example 1

This element with the `list` role only owns elements with the `listitem` role. The `listitem` role is one of the [required owned elements][] for `list`.

```html
<div role="list">
	<span role="listitem">Item 1</span>
	<span role="listitem">Item 2</span>
</div>
```

#### Passed Example 2

This element with the `tablist` role only owns elements with the `tab` role. The `tab` role is one of the [required owned elements][] for `tablist`.

```html
<ul role="tablist">
	<li role="tab">Tab 1</li>
	<li role="tab">Tab 2</li>
</ul>
```

#### Passed Example 3

This element with the `grid` role only owns elements with the `row` role, and the element with the `row` role only owns elements with the `cell` role. The `row` role is one of the [required owned elements][] for `grid`, and `cell` is one of the [required owned elements][] for `row`.

```html
<table role="grid">
	<tr role="row">
		<span role="cell">Item 1</span>
	</tr>
</table>
```

#### Passed Example 4

This element with the `menu` role only owns elements with the `menuitem`, `menuitemradio` and `menuitemcheckbox` role. These roles are all [required owned elements][] for `menu`. The element with the `none` role is not [owned by][] the `menu` because it is not [included in the accessibility tree][].

```html
<div role="menu">
	<li role="none"></li>
	<li role="menuitem">Item 1</li>
	<div role="menuitemradio" aria-checked="false">Item 2</div>
	<div role="menuitemcheckbox" aria-checked="false">Item 3</div>
</div>
```

#### Passed Example 5

This element with the `list` role only owns elements with the `listitem` role through the `aria-owns` attribute. The `listitem` role is one of the [required owned elements][] for `list`.

**Note:** This test case follows the definition of [owned by][]. If implemented differently, this definition could cause differences in outcome of this test case.

```html
<div role="list" aria-owns="id1"></div>
<div id="id1" role="listitem">Item 1</div>
```

#### Passed Example 6

This element with the `list` role only owns elements with the `listitem` role, or elements with the `group` role, in which each element has the `listitem` role. Both the `listitem` role on its own, and the `group` role (when containing elements with the `listitem` role) are [required owned elements][] for `list`.

```html
<div role="list">
	<span role="listitem">Item 1</span>
	<div role="group">
		<span role="listitem">Item 2</span>
		<span role="listitem">Item 3</span>
	</div>
</div>
```

#### Passed Example 7

This element with the `menu` role only owns an element with a `group` role. The `group` in turn owns an element with the `menuitem` role, and an element with the `group` role, in which each element has the `menuitem` role. ARIA `group` roles are allowed to own other elements with a `group` role.

```html
<div role="menu">
	<div role="group">
		<span role="menuitem">Item 1</span>
		<div role="group">
			<span role="menuitem">Item 2</span>
			<span role="menuitem">Item 3</span>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
```

### Failed

#### Failed Example 1

This element with the `list` role owns an element without any of its [required owned elements][] (`listitem` or `group` containing `listitem`).

```html
<div role="list">
	<span>Item 1</span>
</div>
```

#### Failed Example 2

This element with the `tablist` role owns an element with the `listitem` role. The `listitem` role is not one of the [required owned elements][] for `tablist`.

```html
<ol role="tablist">
	<li role="listitem">Item 1</li>
</ol>
```

#### Failed Example 3

This element with the `list` role owns an element with the `listitem` role, and one with the `link` role. The `link` role is not one of the [required owned elements][] for `list`.

```html
<div role="list">
	<li>Item 1</li>
	<span role="link">Item 2</span>
</div>
```

#### Failed Example 4

This element with the `grid` role only owns elements with the `row` role, but the element with the `row` role does not own elements with the `cell` role. The `cell` is one of the [required owned elements][] for `row`.

```html
<div role="grid">
	<div role="row">
		<span>Item 1</span>
	</div>
</div>
```

#### Failed Example 5

This element with the `list` role owns an element with the `tab` role through the `aria-owns` attribute. The `tab` role is not one of the [required owned elements][] for `list`.

**Note:** This test case follows the definition of [owned by][]. If implemented differently, this definition could cause differences in outcome of this test case.

```html
<div role="list" aria-owns="id2"></div>
<div id="id2" role="tab">Tab 1</div>
```

#### Failed Example 6

This element with the `list` role owns an element with the `group` role, but the group owns elements with the `tab` role. The `group` is not a [required owned elements][] for `list`, if it owns elements with a [semantic role][] other then `listitem`.

```html
<div role="list">
	<div role="group">
		<span role="tab">Item 1</span>
		<span role="tab">Item 2</span>
	</div>
</div>
```

#### Failed Example 7

This element with the `menu` role only owns an element with a `group` role. The `group` in turn owns an element with the `menuitem` role, and an element with the `group` role, in which each element has the `treeitem` role. ARIA `group` roles are allowed to own other elements with a `group` role, but those nested `group` nodes must still meet the requirements.

```html
<div role="menu">
	<div role="group">
		<span role="menuitem">Item 1</span>
		<div role="group">
			<span role="treeitem">Item 1</span>
			<span role="treeitem">Item 2</span>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
```

### Inapplicable

#### Inapplicable Example 1

This element with the `list` role is not included in the accessibility tree because the `aria-hidden` attribute is set to `true`.

```html
<div role="list" aria-hidden="true"></div>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 2

This `ul` element does not have an [explicit semantic role][].

```html
<ul>
	<li>Item 1</li>
</ul>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 3

This element with the `progressbar` role does not need [required owned elements][].

```html
<div role="progressbar" aria-valuenow="20" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100">20 %</div>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 4

This element with the `menu` role has an `aria-busy` attribute set to `true`.

```html
<ul role="menu" aria-busy="true">
	Loading
</ul>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 5

This element with the `combobox` role conforms to [WAI-ARIA 1.1][] without owned elements.

```html
<label for="combo">My Combobox</label> <input role="combobox" aria-expanded="false" id="combo" />
```

## Glossary

### Attribute value {#attribute-value}

The _attribute value_ of a content attribute set on an HTML element is the value that the attribute gets after being parsed and computed according to specifications. It may differ from the value that is actually written in the HTML code due to trimming whitespace or non-digits characters, default values, or case-insensitivity.

Some notable case of attribute value, among others:

- For [enumerated attributes][], the _attribute value_ is either the state of the attribute, or the keyword that maps to it; even for the default states. Thus `<input type="image" />` has an attribute value of either `Image Button` (the state) or `image` (the keyword mapping to it), both formulations having the same meaning; similarly, "an input element with a `type` _attribute value_ of `Text`" can be either `<input type="text" />`, `<input />` (missing value default), or `<input type="invalid" />` (invalid value default).
- For [boolean attributes][], the _attribute value_ is `true` when the attribute is present and `false` otherwise. Thus `<button disabled>`, `<button disabled="disabled">` and `<button disabled="">` all have a `disabled` _attribute value_ of `true`.
- For attributes whose value is used in a case-insensitive context, the _attribute value_ is the lowercase version of the value written in the HTML code.
- For attributes that accept [numbers][], the _attribute value_ is the result of parsing the value written in the HTML code according to the rules for parsing this kind of number.
- For attributes that accept sets of tokens, whether [space separated][] or [comma separated][], the _attribute value_ is the set of tokens obtained after parsing the set and, depending on the case, converting its items to lowercase (if the set is used in a case-insensitive context).
- For `aria-*` attributes, the _attribute value_ is computed as indicated in the [WAI-ARIA specification][] and the [HTML Accessibility API Mappings][html aam].

This list is not exhaustive, and only serves as an illustration for some of the most common cases.

The _attribute value_ of an [IDL attribute][] is the value returned on getting it. Note that when an [IDL attribute][] [reflects][reflect] a content attribute, they have the same attribute value.

### Explicit Semantic Role {#explicit-role}

The _explicit semantic role_ of an element is determined by its [role attribute][] (if any).

The [role attribute][] takes a list of tokens. The explicit semantic role is the first valid role in this list. The valid roles are all non-abstract roles from [WAI-ARIA Specifications][]. If the element has no [role attribute][], or if it has one with no valid role, then this element has no explicit semantic role.

Other roles may be added as they become available. Not all roles will be supported in all assistive technologies. Testers are encouraged to adjust which roles are allowed according to the [accessibility support base line][]. For the purposes of executing test cases in all rules, it should be assumed that all roles are supported by assistive technologies so that none of the roles fail due to lack of accessibility support.

### Focusable {#focusable}

Elements that can become the target of keyboard input as described in the [HTML](https://www.w3.org/TR/html) specification of [focusable](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#focusable-area) and [can be focused](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#specially-focusable).

### Implicit Semantic Role {#implicit-role}

The _implicit semantic role_ of an element is a pre-defined value given by the host language which depends on the element and its ancestors.

Implicit roles for HTML and SVG, are documented in the [HTML accessibility API mappings (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam/#html-element-role-mappings) and the [SVG accessibility API mappings (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg-aam/#mapping_role_table).

### Included in the accessibility tree {#included-in-the-accessibility-tree}

Elements included in the accessibility tree of platform specific accessibility APIs are exposed to assistive technologies. This allows users of assistive technology to access the elements in a way that meets the requirements of the individual user.

The general rules for when elements are included in the accessibility tree are defined in the [core accessibility API mappings](https://www.w3.org/TR/core-aam/). For native markup languages, such as HTML and SVG, additional rules for when elements are included in the accessibility tree can be found in the [HTML accessibility API mappings (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam/) and the [SVG accessibility API mappings (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg-aam/).

For more details, see [examples of included in the accessibility tree][].

[Programmatically hidden](#programmatically-hidden) elements are removed from the accessibility tree. However, some browsers will leave [focusable](#focusable) elements with an `aria-hidden` attribute set to `true` in the accessibility tree. Because they are hidden, these elements are considered **not** included in the accessibility tree. This may cause confusion for users of assistive technologies because they may still be able to interact with these focusable elements using sequential keyboard navigation, even though the element should not be included in the accessibility tree.

### Marked as decorative {#marked-as-decorative}

An element is _marked as decorative_ if one or more of the following conditions is true:

- it has an [explicit role][] of `none` or `presentation`; or
- it is an `img` element with an `alt` attribute whose value is the empty string (`alt=""`), and with no [explicit role][].

Elements are marked as decorative as a way to convey the intention of the author that they are [pure decoration][]. It is different from the element actually being [pure decoration][] as authors may make mistakes. It is different from the element being effectively ignored by assistive technologies as rules such as [presentational roles conflict resolution][] may overwrite this intention.

Elements can also be ignored by assistive technologies if they are [programmatically hidden][]. This is different from marking the element as decorative and does not convey the same intention. Notably, being [programmatically hidden][] may change as users interact with the page (showing and hiding elements) while being marked as decorative should stay the same through all states of the page.

### Namespaced Element {#namespaced-element}

An [element][] with a specific [namespaceURI][] value from [HTML namespaces][]. For example an "SVG element" is any element with the "SVG namespace", which is `http://www.w3.org/2000/svg`.

Namespaced elements are not limited to elements described in a specification. They also include custom elements. Elements such as `a` and `title` have a different namespace depending on where they are used. For example a `title` in an HTML page usually has the HTML namespace. When used in an `svg` element, a `title` element has the SVG namespace instead.

### Outcome {#outcome}

An _outcome_ is a conclusion that comes from evaluating an ACT Rule on a [test subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-subject) or one of its constituent [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target). An outcome can be one of the three following types:

- **Inapplicable:** No part of the test subject matches the applicability
- **Passed:** A [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target) meets all expectations
- **Failed:** A [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target) does not meet all expectations

**Note:** A rule has one `passed` or `failed` outcome for every [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target). When there are no test targets the rule has one `inapplicable` outcome. This means that each [test subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-subject) will have one or more outcomes.

**Note:** Implementations using the [EARL10-Schema](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/) can express the outcome with the [outcome property](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/#outcome). In addition to `passed`, `failed` and `inapplicable`, EARL 1.0 also defined an `incomplete` outcome. While this cannot be the outcome of an ACT Rule when applied in its entirety, it often happens that rules are only partially evaluated. For example, when applicability was automated, but the expectations have to be evaluated manually. Such "interim" results can be expressed with the `incomplete` outcome.

### Owned by {#owned-by}

An element A is _owned by_ element B if element A is a child of element B in the [accessibility tree][].

Being a child in the [accessibility tree][] is different from being a child in the DOM tree. Some DOM nodes have no corresponding node in the [accessibility tree][] (for example, because they are marked with `role="presentation"`). A child in the [accessibility tree][] can thus correspond to a descendant in the DOM tree. Additionally, the use of `aria-owns` attribute can change the tree structure to something which is not a subtree of the DOM tree.

This definition is different from the definition of ["owned element" in WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#dfn-owned-element). Because browsers have different accessibility trees, which element owns which other elements can vary between browsers. Until there is a standard accessibility tree, testing with multiple accessibility trees may be necessary.

### Programmatically Hidden {#programmatically-hidden}

An HTML element is _programmatically hidden_ if either it has a [computed][] CSS property `visibility` whose value is not `visible`; or at least one of the following is true for any of its [inclusive ancestors][] in the [flat tree][]:

- has a `hidden` attribute; or
- has a [computed][] CSS property `display` of `none`; or
- has an `aria-hidden` attribute set to `true`

**Note**: Contrarily to the other conditions, the `visibility` CSS property may be reverted by descendants.

### Semantic Role {#semantic-role}

The _semantic role_ of an element is determined by the first of these cases that applies:

1. **Conflict** If the element is [marked as decorative][], but the element is [included in the accessibility tree][]; or would be [included in the accessibility tree][] when it is not [programmatically hidden][], then its _semantic role_ is its **[implicit role][]**.
1. **Explicit** If the element has an [explicit role][], then its _semantic role_ is its [explicit role][].
1. **Implicit** The _semantic role_ of the element is its [implicit role][].

This definition can be used in expressions such as "semantic `button`" meaning any element with a semantic role of `button`.

### WAI-ARIA specifications {#wai-aria-specifications}

The _WAI ARIA Specifications_ group both the WAI ARIA W3C Recommendation and ARIA modules, namely:

- [Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/)
- [WAI-ARIA Graphics Module 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/graphics-aria-1.0/)
- [Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/dpub-aria-1.0/)

**Note:** depending on the type of content being evaluated, part of the specifications might be irrelevant and should be ignored.
