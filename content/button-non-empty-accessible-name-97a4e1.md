## Applicability

This rule applies to elements that are [included in the accessibility tree][] and have a [semantic role](#semantic-role) of `button`, except for `input` elements with a `type` [attribute value] of `image`.

## Expectation

Each target element has an [accessible name][] that is not empty (`""`).

## Assumptions

- The rule assumes that all buttons are [user interface components as defined by WCAG 2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-user-interface-components).

## Accessibility Support

- Implementation of [Presentational Roles Conflict Resolution][] varies from one browser or assistive technology to another. Depending on this, some elements can have a [semantic role][] of `button` and fail this rule with some technology but users of other technologies would not experience any accessibility issue.

- Some elements have a role of `button` and a default accessible name defined by the [HTML Accessibility API Mapping][html aam input button], for example `input` elements whose `type` [attribute value][] is either `submit` or `reset`. This rule considers that these default names can be descriptive and therefore does not fail them.

## Test Cases

### Passed

#### Passed Example 1

This `button` element has an [accessible name][] because of its text content.

```html
<button>My button</button>
```

#### Passed Example 2

This `input` element has an [accessible name][] because of its `value` attribute.

```html
<input type="submit" value="Submit" />
```

#### Passed Example 3

This `button` element has an [accessible name][] because of its `aria-label` attribute.

```html
<button aria-label="My button"></button>
```

#### Passed Example 4

This element with a `button` role has an [accessible name][] because of its `aria-label` attribute.

```html
<span role="button" aria-label="My button"></span>
```

#### Passed Example 5

This `button` element with the `disabled` attribute has an [accessible name][] because of its text content.

```html
<button disabled>Delete</button>
```

#### Passed Example 6

This off screen `button` element has an [accessible name][] because of its text content.

```html
<html>
	<style>
		.notInPage {
			position: absolute;
			left: -9999px;
			top: -9999px;
		}
	</style>
	<body>
		<button class="notInPage">Save</button>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 7

This `input` element has an [accessible name][] because of the default accessible name for an `input` element with a `type` attribute set to `reset`.

```html
<input type="reset" />
```

### Failed

#### Failed Example 1

This `button` element has no [accessible name][] because it has no content or attribute that can provide it.

```html
<button></button>
```

#### Failed Example 2

This `button` element has no [accessible name][]. The `value` attribute does not provide an [accessible name][] for `button` elements, only when an `input` element's [state of the `type` attribute](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#states-of-the-type-attribute) is `button`, `submit` or `reset`.

```html
<button type="button" value="read more"></button>
```

#### Failed Example 3

This element with the `button` role has no [accessible name][] because it has no content or attribute that can provide it.

```html
<span role="button"></span>
```

#### Failed Example 4

This off screen `button` element has no [accessible name][] because it has no content or attribute that can provide it.

```html
<html>
	<style>
		.notInPage {
			position: absolute;
			left: -9999px;
			top: -9999px;
		}
	</style>
	<body>
		<button class="notInPage" value="delete"></button>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Failed Example 5

This `button` element has an [explicit role][] of `none`. However, it is [focusable][] (by default). Thus it has a [semantic role][] of `button` due to [Presentational Roles Conflict Resolution][]. It has an empty [accessible name][].

```html
<button role="none"></button>
```

### Inapplicable

#### Inapplicable Example 1

This `input` element has a `type` attribute set to `image`. These images are tested in a separate rule which also tests [success criterion 1.1.1 Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#non-text-content).

```html
<input type="image" value="download" alt="Download" />
```

#### Inapplicable Example 2

This `button` element does not need an [accessible name][] because it is not included in the accessibility tree.

```html
<button style="display: none;"></button>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 3

This `button` element has a `link` role. Links are tested in a separate rule which also tests [success criterion 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#link-purpose-in-context).

```html
<button role="link">take me somewhere</button>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 4

There is no element with a semantic role of `button`.

```html
<div>Press Here</div>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 5

This `button` element has an [explicit role][] of `none`; it is not [focusable][] because it is `disabled`. Thus it has a [semantic role][] of `none`.

```html
<button role="none" disabled></button>
```

## Glossary

### Accessible Name {#accessible-name}

The _accessible name_ is the programmatically determined name of a user interface element that is [included in the accessibility tree](#included-in-the-accessibility-tree).

The accessible name is calculated using the [accessible name and description computation][].

For native markup languages, such as HTML and SVG, additional information on how to calculate the accessible name can be found in [HTML Accessibility API Mappings 1.0, Accessible Name and Description Computation (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam/#accessible-name-and-description-computation) and [SVG Accessibility API Mappings, Name and Description (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg-aam/#mapping_additional).

For more details, see [examples of accessible name][].

**Note:** As per the [accessible name and description computation][], each element always has an accessible name. When no accessible name is provided, the element will nonetheless be assigned an empty (`""`) one.

**Note:** As per the [accessible name and description computation][], accessible names are [flat string](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.1/#terminology) trimmed of leading and trailing whitespace. Notably, it is not possible for a non-empty accessible name to be composed only of whitespace since these must be trimmed.

### Attribute value {#attribute-value}

The _attribute value_ of a content attribute set on an HTML element is the value that the attribute gets after being parsed and computed according to specifications. It may differ from the value that is actually written in the HTML code due to trimming whitespace or non-digits characters, default values, or case-insensitivity.

Some notable case of attribute value, among others:

- For [enumerated attributes][], the _attribute value_ is either the state of the attribute, or the keyword that maps to it; even for the default states. Thus `<input type="image" />` has an attribute value of either `Image Button` (the state) or `image` (the keyword mapping to it), both formulations having the same meaning; similarly, "an input element with a `type` _attribute value_ of `Text`" can be either `<input type="text" />`, `<input />` (missing value default), or `<input type="invalid" />` (invalid value default).
- For [boolean attributes][], the _attribute value_ is `true` when the attribute is present and `false` otherwise. Thus `<button disabled>`, `<button disabled="disabled">` and `<button disabled="">` all have a `disabled` _attribute value_ of `true`.
- For attributes whose value is used in a case-insensitive context, the _attribute value_ is the lowercase version of the value written in the HTML code.
- For attributes that accept [numbers][], the _attribute value_ is the result of parsing the value written in the HTML code according to the rules for parsing this kind of number.
- For attributes that accept sets of tokens, whether [space separated][] or [comma separated][], the _attribute value_ is the set of tokens obtained after parsing the set and, depending on the case, converting its items to lowercase (if the set is used in a case-insensitive context).
- For `aria-*` attributes, the _attribute value_ is computed as indicated in the [WAI-ARIA specification][] and the [HTML Accessibility API Mappings][html aam].

This list is not exhaustive, and only serves as an illustration for some of the most common cases.

The _attribute value_ of an [IDL attribute][] is the value returned on getting it. Note that when an [IDL attribute][] [reflects][reflect] a content attribute, they have the same attribute value.

### Explicit Semantic Role {#explicit-role}

The _explicit semantic role_ of an element is determined by its [role attribute][] (if any).

The [role attribute][] takes a list of tokens. The explicit semantic role is the first valid role in this list. The valid roles are all non-abstract roles from [WAI-ARIA Specifications][]. If the element has no [role attribute][], or if it has one with no valid role, then this element has no explicit semantic role.

Other roles may be added as they become available. Not all roles will be supported in all assistive technologies. Testers are encouraged to adjust which roles are allowed according to the [accessibility support base line][]. For the purposes of executing test cases in all rules, it should be assumed that all roles are supported by assistive technologies so that none of the roles fail due to lack of accessibility support.

### Focusable {#focusable}

Elements that can become the target of keyboard input as described in the [HTML](https://www.w3.org/TR/html) specification of [focusable](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#focusable-area) and [can be focused](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#specially-focusable).

### Implicit Semantic Role {#implicit-role}

The _implicit semantic role_ of an element is a pre-defined value given by the host language which depends on the element and its ancestors.

Implicit roles for HTML and SVG, are documented in the [HTML accessibility API mappings (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam/#html-element-role-mappings) and the [SVG accessibility API mappings (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg-aam/#mapping_role_table).

### Included in the accessibility tree {#included-in-the-accessibility-tree}

Elements included in the accessibility tree of platform specific accessibility APIs are exposed to assistive technologies. This allows users of assistive technology to access the elements in a way that meets the requirements of the individual user.

The general rules for when elements are included in the accessibility tree are defined in the [core accessibility API mappings](https://www.w3.org/TR/core-aam/). For native markup languages, such as HTML and SVG, additional rules for when elements are included in the accessibility tree can be found in the [HTML accessibility API mappings (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam/) and the [SVG accessibility API mappings (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg-aam/).

For more details, see [examples of included in the accessibility tree][].

[Programmatically hidden](#programmatically-hidden) elements are removed from the accessibility tree. However, some browsers will leave [focusable](#focusable) elements with an `aria-hidden` attribute set to `true` in the accessibility tree. Because they are hidden, these elements are considered **not** included in the accessibility tree. This may cause confusion for users of assistive technologies because they may still be able to interact with these focusable elements using sequential keyboard navigation, even though the element should not be included in the accessibility tree.

### Marked as decorative {#marked-as-decorative}

An element is _marked as decorative_ if one or more of the following conditions is true:

- it has an [explicit role][] of `none` or `presentation`; or
- it is an `img` element with an `alt` attribute whose value is the empty string (`alt=""`), and with no [explicit role][].

Elements are marked as decorative as a way to convey the intention of the author that they are [pure decoration][]. It is different from the element actually being [pure decoration][] as authors may make mistakes. It is different from the element being effectively ignored by assistive technologies as rules such as [presentational roles conflict resolution][] may overwrite this intention.

Elements can also be ignored by assistive technologies if they are [programmatically hidden][]. This is different from marking the element as decorative and does not convey the same intention. Notably, being [programmatically hidden][] may change as users interact with the page (showing and hiding elements) while being marked as decorative should stay the same through all states of the page.

### Outcome {#outcome}

An _outcome_ is a conclusion that comes from evaluating an ACT Rule on a [test subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-subject) or one of its constituent [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target). An outcome can be one of the three following types:

- **Inapplicable:** No part of the test subject matches the applicability
- **Passed:** A [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target) meets all expectations
- **Failed:** A [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target) does not meet all expectations

**Note:** A rule has one `passed` or `failed` outcome for every [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target). When there are no test targets the rule has one `inapplicable` outcome. This means that each [test subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-subject) will have one or more outcomes.

**Note:** Implementations using the [EARL10-Schema](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/) can express the outcome with the [outcome property](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/#outcome). In addition to `passed`, `failed` and `inapplicable`, EARL 1.0 also defined an `incomplete` outcome. While this cannot be the outcome of an ACT Rule when applied in its entirety, it often happens that rules are only partially evaluated. For example, when applicability was automated, but the expectations have to be evaluated manually. Such "interim" results can be expressed with the `incomplete` outcome.

### Programmatically Hidden {#programmatically-hidden}

An HTML element is _programmatically hidden_ if either it has a [computed][] CSS property `visibility` whose value is not `visible`; or at least one of the following is true for any of its [inclusive ancestors][] in the [flat tree][]:

- has a `hidden` attribute; or
- has a [computed][] CSS property `display` of `none`; or
- has an `aria-hidden` attribute set to `true`

**Note**: Contrarily to the other conditions, the `visibility` CSS property may be reverted by descendants.

### Semantic Role {#semantic-role}

The _semantic role_ of an element is determined by the first of these cases that applies:

1. **Conflict** If the element is [marked as decorative][], but the element is [included in the accessibility tree][]; or would be [included in the accessibility tree][] when it is not [programmatically hidden][], then its _semantic role_ is its **[implicit role][]**.
1. **Explicit** If the element has an [explicit role][], then its _semantic role_ is its [explicit role][].
1. **Implicit** The _semantic role_ of the element is its [implicit role][].

This definition can be used in expressions such as "semantic `button`" meaning any element with a semantic role of `button`.

### WAI-ARIA specifications {#wai-aria-specifications}

The _WAI ARIA Specifications_ group both the WAI ARIA W3C Recommendation and ARIA modules, namely:

- [Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/)
- [WAI-ARIA Graphics Module 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/graphics-aria-1.0/)
- [Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/dpub-aria-1.0/)

**Note:** depending on the type of content being evaluated, part of the specifications might be irrelevant and should be ignored.
