## Applicability

This rule applies to any `audio` or `video` element for which all the following are true:

- **autoplay**: the element has an `autoplay` [attribute value][] of `true`; and
- **not muted**: the element has a `muted` [attribute value][] of `false`; and
- **not paused**: the element has a `paused` [attribute value][] of `false`; and
- **duration**: the element has a [media resource][] lasting more than 3 seconds that contains audio.

## Expectation

For each test target the total audio output does not last more than 3 seconds.

**Note:** This rule does not cover single audio instances that play repeatedly for more than three seconds, or multiple audio instances for more than three seconds. The [WCAG Understanding documentation for 1.4.2 Audio Controls](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/audio-control.html) is ambiguous about how to handle these scenarios.

## Assumptions

_There are currently no assumptions_

## Accessibility Support

_There are no major accessibility support issues known for this rule._

## Background

- [Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.2: Audio Control](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/audio-control.html)
- [F23: Failure of 1.4.2 due to playing a sound longer than 3 seconds where there is no mechanism to turn it off](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/failures/F23)
- [G60: Playing a sound that turns off automatically within three seconds](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G60)
- [G171: Playing sounds only on user request](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G171)

## Test Cases

### Passed

#### Passed Example 1

This `audio` element does not play automatically for more than 3 seconds.

```html
<audio src="/test-assets/moon-audio/moon-speech.mp3#t=25" autoplay></audio>
```

#### Passed Example 2

This `video` element's audio output does not last longer than 3 seconds.

```html
<video autoplay>
	<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/video.mp4#t=8,10" type="video/mp4" />
	<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/video.webm#t=8,10" type="video/webm" />
</video>
```

### Failed

#### Failed Example 1

This `audio` element plays automatically for more than 3 seconds.

```html
<audio src="/test-assets/moon-audio/moon-speech.mp3" autoplay controls></audio>
```

#### Failed Example 2

This `video` element plays some audio automatically for more than 3 seconds.

```html
<video autoplay>
	<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
	<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/video.webm" type="video/webm" />
</video>
```

### Inapplicable

#### Inapplicable Example 1

This `video` element has audio that autoplays for longer than 3 seconds but is muted.

```html
<video autoplay muted>
	<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
	<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/video.webm" type="video/webm" />
</video>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 2

This `video` element refers to a source file that has no audio output.

```html
<video autoplay>
	<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/silent.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
	<source src="/test-assets/rabbit-video/silent.webm" type="video/webm" />
</video>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 3

This `audio` element does not autoplay.

```html
<audio src="/test-assets/moon-audio/moon-speech.mp3" controls></audio>
```

## Glossary

### Attribute value {#attribute-value}

The _attribute value_ of a content attribute set on an HTML element is the value that the attribute gets after being parsed and computed according to specifications. It may differ from the value that is actually written in the HTML code due to trimming whitespace or non-digits characters, default values, or case-insensitivity.

Some notable case of attribute value, among others:

- For [enumerated attributes][], the _attribute value_ is either the state of the attribute, or the keyword that maps to it; even for the default states. Thus `<input type="image" />` has an attribute value of either `Image Button` (the state) or `image` (the keyword mapping to it), both formulations having the same meaning; similarly, "an input element with a `type` _attribute value_ of `Text`" can be either `<input type="text" />`, `<input />` (missing value default), or `<input type="invalid" />` (invalid value default).
- For [boolean attributes][], the _attribute value_ is `true` when the attribute is present and `false` otherwise. Thus `<button disabled>`, `<button disabled="disabled">` and `<button disabled="">` all have a `disabled` _attribute value_ of `true`.
- For attributes whose value is used in a case-insensitive context, the _attribute value_ is the lowercase version of the value written in the HTML code.
- For attributes that accept [numbers][], the _attribute value_ is the result of parsing the value written in the HTML code according to the rules for parsing this kind of number.
- For attributes that accept sets of tokens, whether [space separated][] or [comma separated][], the _attribute value_ is the set of tokens obtained after parsing the set and, depending on the case, converting its items to lowercase (if the set is used in a case-insensitive context).
- For `aria-*` attributes, the _attribute value_ is computed as indicated in the [WAI-ARIA specification][] and the [HTML Accessibility API Mappings][html aam].

This list is not exhaustive, and only serves as an illustration for some of the most common cases.

The _attribute value_ of an [IDL attribute][] is the value returned on getting it. Note that when an [IDL attribute][] [reflects][reflect] a content attribute, they have the same attribute value.

### Outcome {#outcome}

An _outcome_ is a conclusion that comes from evaluating an ACT Rule on a [test subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-subject) or one of its constituent [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target). An outcome can be one of the three following types:

- **Inapplicable:** No part of the test subject matches the applicability
- **Passed:** A [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target) meets all expectations
- **Failed:** A [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target) does not meet all expectations

**Note:** A rule has one `passed` or `failed` outcome for every [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target). When there are no test targets the rule has one `inapplicable` outcome. This means that each [test subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-subject) will have one or more outcomes.

**Note:** Implementations using the [EARL10-Schema](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/) can express the outcome with the [outcome property](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/#outcome). In addition to `passed`, `failed` and `inapplicable`, EARL 1.0 also defined an `incomplete` outcome. While this cannot be the outcome of an ACT Rule when applied in its entirety, it often happens that rules are only partially evaluated. For example, when applicability was automated, but the expectations have to be evaluated manually. Such "interim" results can be expressed with the `incomplete` outcome.
