## Applicability

This rule applies to any set of any two or more `iframe` elements which:

- are in the same [web page (HTML)][]; and
- are [included in an accessibility tree][included in the accessibility tree]; and
- that have [matching][] [accessible names][accessible name] that are not empty (`""`).

**Note:** The test target for this rule is the full set of `iframe` elements that share the same [matching](#matching-characters) [accessible name][].

## Expectation

The `iframe` elements in each set of target elements embed the [same resource][] or [equivalent resources](#equivalent-resource).

**Note:** Resolving the embedded resource includes any redirects that are instant.

## Assumptions

- This rule assumes that, within the context of the test subject, the description provided by the [accessible name][] of an `iframe` can only accurately describe one resource (notably, homonyms alone are not used as `iframe` names). Thus, if two or more `iframe` elements have the same [accessible name][] but embed different resources, at least one of them does not describe its purpose.
- This rule assumes that the language of each test target can be correctly determined (either programmatically or by analyzing the content), and sufficiently understood.

## Accessibility Support

This rule assumes that assistive technologies are exposing all `iframe` elements on the page in the same way no matter which [document tree](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#document-trees) they are in. If an assistive technology requires the user to "enter" an `iframe` or a [shadow tree][] before exposing its content (notably nested `iframe`), then it is possible for two `iframe` to have identical name but embed different resources without failing [Success Criterion 4.1.2: Name, Role, Value][sc412] (if said `iframe` are in separate [documents][document] or [shadow trees][shadow tree])

## Background

- [CSS Scoping Module Level 1 (editor's draft)](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scoping/)
- [H64: Using the title attribute of the frame and iframe elements](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H64)
- [Understanding Success Criterion 4.1.2: Name, Role, Value][usc412]

## Test Cases

### Passed

#### Passed Example 1

Two `iframe` elements within the same [document tree][] have the same [accessible name][] (given by the `title` attribute) and embed the same resource.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<iframe title="List of Contributors" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/page-one.html"> </iframe>

	<iframe title="List of Contributors" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/page-one.html"> </iframe>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 2

Two `iframe` elements within the same [document tree][] have the same [accessible name][] (given by the `title` and `aria-label` attributes) and embed the same resource.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<iframe title="List of Contributors" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/page-one.html"> </iframe>

	<iframe aria-label="List of Contributors" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/page-one.html"> </iframe>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 3

Two `iframe` elements within the same [document tree][] have the same [accessible name][] (given by the `aria-labelledby` attribute and corresponding elements) and embed the same resource.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<div id="desc-for-title">List of Contributors</div>
	<iframe aria-labelledby="desc-for-title" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/page-one.html"> </iframe>

	<div id="desc-for-title1">List of Contributors</div>
	<iframe aria-labelledby="desc-for-title1" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/page-one.html"> </iframe>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 4

Two `iframe` elements within the same [document tree][] have the same [accessible name][] (given by the `title` attribute) and embed equivalent resources. Only the navigation options (bread crumbs and local sub menus) differ due to different placement in navigation hierarchy.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<iframe title="Contact us" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/page-one.html"> </iframe>

	<iframe title="Contact us" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/sub-dir/page-one.html"> </iframe>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 5

Two `iframe` elements within the same [document tree][] have the same [accessible name][] (given by the `title` attribute) and embed equivalent resources.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<iframe title="Contact us" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/page-one.html"> </iframe>

	<iframe title="Contact us" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/page-one-copy.html"> </iframe>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 6

Two `iframe` elements within the same [document tree][] have the same [accessible name][] (given by the `title` attribute) and embed the same resource. `src` attributes only differ due to trailing slashes, but resolves to the same resource after redirects caused by user agent.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<iframe title="Contact us" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/sub-dir-2/"> </iframe>

	<iframe title="Contact us" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/sub-dir-2"> </iframe>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 7

Two `iframe` elements within the same [document tree][] have the same [accessible name][] (given by the `title` attribute) and embed equivalent resources. Resources differ by the amount of information available and/or a differently worded information.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<iframe title="Contact us" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/page-one.html"> </iframe>

	<iframe title="Contact us" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/page-three-same-as-page-one.html"> </iframe>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 8

Two `iframe` elements within the same [document tree][] have the same [accessible name][] (given by the `title` attribute) and embed equivalent resources. Each `iframe` refers to a different url that referenced different advertising content (giving by a third party) but embed resources has equivalent purpose: showing an advertising.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<iframe title="advertising" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/advertising-one.html"> </iframe>

	<iframe title="advertising" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/advertising-two.html"> </iframe>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 9

All three `iframe` elements have the same [accessible name][]. The second `iframe` (with `id` `"light"` ) is only part of the [light tree][]. When the [shadow tree][] is attached to `host` and flattened, this `iframe` is overwritten and therefore not part of the [flat tree][]. Hence, only the first and third `iframe` are considered by this rule and they both point to the [same resource][].

```html
<iframe id="always" title="List of Contributors" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/page-one.html"> </iframe>

<div id="host">
	<iframe id="light" title="List of Contributors" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/page-two.html"> </iframe>
</div>

<script>
	const host = document.getElementById('host')
	const shadowRoot = host.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' })
	shadowRoot.innerHTML =
		'<iframe id="shadow" title="List of Contributors" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/page-one.html"> </iframe>'
</script>
```

#### Passed Example 10

The [browsing context][] of the `iframe` with `id` `"container"` has the [browsing context][] of the main [document][] as an [ancestor browsing context][]. Hence, they share the same [top-level browsing context][] (namely, the [browsing context][] of the main [document][]) and are part of the same [web page (HTML)][]. Therefore, both `iframe` with `id` `"top-level"` and `"nested"` are considered and, since they embed the same document, the rule passes.

```html
<iframe id="top-level" title="List of Contributors" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/page-one.html">
</iframe>

<iframe
	id="container"
	srcdoc="<iframe id='nested' title='List of Contributors' src='/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/page-one.html'> </iframe>"
></iframe>
```

### Failed

#### Failed Example 1

Two `iframe` elements within the same [document tree][] have the same [accessible name][] (given by the `title` attribute) but don't embed equivalent resources.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<iframe title="List of Contributors" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/page-one.html"> </iframe>

	<iframe title="List of Contributors" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/page-two.html"> </iframe>
</html>
```

#### Failed Example 2

Two `iframe` elements within the same [document tree][] have the same [accessible name][] (given by the `aria-label` attribute) but don't embed equivalent resources.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<iframe aria-label="List of Contributors" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/page-one.html"> </iframe>

	<iframe aria-label="List of Contributors" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/page-two.html"> </iframe>
</html>
```

#### Failed Example 3

Two `iframe` elements within the same [document tree][] have the same [accessible name][] (given by the `title` and `aria-label` attributes) but don't embed equivalent resources.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<iframe title="List of Contributors" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/page-one.html"> </iframe>

	<iframe aria-label="List of Contributors" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/page-two.html"> </iframe>
</html>
```

#### Failed Example 4

The [browsing context][] of the `iframe` with `id` `"container"` has the [browsing context][] of the main [document][] as an [ancestor browsing context][]. Hence, they share the same [top-level browsing context][] (namely, the [browsing context][] of the main [document][]) and are part of the same [web page (HTML)][]. Therefore, both `iframe` with `id` `"top-level"` and `"nested"` are considered and the rule fails.

```html
<iframe id="top-level" title="List of Contributors" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/page-one.html">
</iframe>

<iframe
	id="container"
	srcdoc="<iframe id='nested' title='List of Contributors' src='/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/page-two.html'> </iframe>"
></iframe>
```

### Inapplicable

#### Inapplicable Example 1

There is only one `iframe` element within the [document tree][]. Therefore, there is no set of two or more `iframe` elements with the same [accessible name][] and the rule is inapplicable.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<iframe title="List of Contributors" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/page-one.html"> </iframe>
</html>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 2

Each of the two `iframe` elements within the [document tree][] has a different [accessible name][] (given by the `title` attribute). Therefore, there is no set of two or more `iframe` elements with the same [accessible name][] and the rule is inapplicable.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<iframe title="List of Contributors to Repository 1" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/page-one.html">
	</iframe>

	<iframe title="List of Contributors to Repository 2" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/page-two.html">
	</iframe>
</html>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 3

Each of the two `iframe` elements within the [document tree][] has a different [accessible name][] (given by the `aria-label` attribute). Therefore, there is no set of two or more `iframe` elements with the same [accessible name][] and the rule is inapplicable.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<iframe aria-label="List of Contributors to Repository 1" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/page-one.html">
	</iframe>

	<iframe aria-label="List of Contributors to Repository 2" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/page-two.html">
	</iframe>
</html>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 4

Each of the two `iframe` elements within the [document tree][] has a different [accessible name][] (given by the `aria-labelledby` attribute and matching elements). Therefore, there is no set of two or more `iframe` elements with the same [accessible name][] and the rule is inapplicable.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<div id="desc-for-title">List of Contributors</div>
	<iframe aria-labelledby="desc-for-title" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/page-one.html"> </iframe>

	<div id="desc-for-title1">List of Reviewers</div>
	<iframe aria-labelledby="desc-for-title1" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/page-two.html"> </iframe>
</html>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 5

Both `iframe` elements have the same [accessible name][] (given by the `title` attribute) within the same [document tree][], but one of them is not [included in the accessibility tree][]. Therefore, there is no set of two or more `iframe` elements that are [included in the accessibility tree][] and have the same [accessible name][], and the rule is inapplicable.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<iframe aria-hidden="true" title="List of Contributors" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/page-one.html">
	</iframe>

	<iframe title="List of Contributors" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/page-two.html"> </iframe>
</html>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 6

The `alt` attribute does not provide an [accessible name][] for `iframe` elements. Therefore, these `iframe` elements do not have an [accessible name][] and the rule is inapplicable.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<iframe alt="Some" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/page-one.html"> </iframe>

	<iframe alt="Some" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/page-one.html"> </iframe>
</html>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 7

The rule does not apply to `object` elements.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<object title="List of Contributors" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/page-one.html"> </object>

	<object aria-label="List of Contributors Clone" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/page-two.html"> </object>
</html>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 8

These `iframe` elements do not have [accessible names][accessible name].

```html
<html lang="en">
	<iframe src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/page-two.html"> </iframe>

	<iframe src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/page-one.html"> </iframe>
</html>
```

#### Inapplicable Example 9

These `iframe` elements are not [included in the accessibility tree][], because of the `display:none` styling.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<iframe style="display:none;" title="Document One" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/page-one.html">
	</iframe>

	<iframe style="display:none;" aria-label="Document One" src="/test-assets/iframe-unique-name-4b1c6c/page-two.html">
	</iframe>
</html>
```

## Glossary

### Accessible Name {#accessible-name}

The _accessible name_ is the programmatically determined name of a user interface element that is [included in the accessibility tree](#included-in-the-accessibility-tree).

The accessible name is calculated using the [accessible name and description computation][].

For native markup languages, such as HTML and SVG, additional information on how to calculate the accessible name can be found in [HTML Accessibility API Mappings 1.0, Accessible Name and Description Computation (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam/#accessible-name-and-description-computation) and [SVG Accessibility API Mappings, Name and Description (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg-aam/#mapping_additional).

For more details, see [examples of accessible name][].

**Note:** As per the [accessible name and description computation][], each element always has an accessible name. When no accessible name is provided, the element will nonetheless be assigned an empty (`""`) one.

**Note:** As per the [accessible name and description computation][], accessible names are [flat string](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.1/#terminology) trimmed of leading and trailing whitespace. Notably, it is not possible for a non-empty accessible name to be composed only of whitespace since these must be trimmed.

### Equivalent resource {#equivalent-resource}

Non-identical resources can still be _equivalent resources_ by equally complying to the expectation formed by the user when navigating to them, thus serving an equivalent purpose. This would usually involve that the advertised key content is the same.

Web pages and documents (e.g. PDFs, office formats etc.) may be equivalent resources, even if the resources:

- are located on different URLs, including different domains
- present different navigation options, e.g. through bread crumbs or local sub menus
- contain different amounts of information and/or differently worded information
- use different layouts.

If all resources cover the user's expectations equally well, the resources are considered to be equivalent.

**Note:** The user's expectations for the resource can be formed by different things, e.g. the name of the link leading to the resource, with or without the context around the link. This depends on the accessibility requirement that is tested.

**Note:** If the same content is presented in different formats or languages, the format or language itself is often part of the purpose of the content, e.g. an article as both HTML and PDF, an image in different sizes, or an article in two different languages. If getting the same content in different formats or languages is the purpose of having separate links, the resources are not equivalent.

### Focusable {#focusable}

Elements that can become the target of keyboard input as described in the [HTML](https://www.w3.org/TR/html) specification of [focusable](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#focusable-area) and [can be focused](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#specially-focusable).

### Included in the accessibility tree {#included-in-the-accessibility-tree}

Elements included in the accessibility tree of platform specific accessibility APIs. Elements in the accessibility tree are exposed to assistive technologies, allowing users to interact with the elements in a way that meet the requirements of the individual user.

The general rules for when elements are included in the accessibility tree are defined in the [core accessibility API mappings](https://www.w3.org/TR/core-aam/). For native markup languages, such as HTML and SVG, additional rules for when elements are included in the accessibility tree can be found in the [HTML accessibility API mappings (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam/) and the [SVG accessibility API mappings (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg-aam/).

For more details, see [examples of included in the accessibility tree][].

**Note:** Users of assistive technologies might still be able to interact with elements that are not included in the accessibility tree. An example of this is a [focusable](#focusable) element with an `aria-hidden` attribute with a value of `true`. Such an element could still be interacted using sequential keyboard navigation regardless of the assistive technologies used, even though the element would not be included in the accessibility tree.
[examples of included in the accessibility tree]: https://act-rules.github.io/pages/examples/included-in-the-accessibility-tree/

### Matching characters {#matching-characters}

A sequence of characters is considered to _match_ another if, after removing leading and trailing [space characters](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#white_space) and replacing remaining occurrences of one or more space characters with a single space, the two sequences of characters are equal character-by-character, ignoring any differences in letter casing.

### Outcome {#outcome}

An _outcome_ is a conclusion that comes from evaluating an ACT Rule on a [test subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-subject) or one of its constituent [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target). An outcome can be one of the three following types:

- **Inapplicable:** No part of the test subject matches the applicability
- **Passed:** A [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target) meets all expectations
- **Failed:** A [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target) does not meet all expectations

**Note:** A rule has one `passed` or `failed` outcome for every [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target). When there are no test targets the rule has one `inapplicable` outcome. This means that each [test subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-subject) will have one or more outcomes.

**Note:** Implementations using the [EARL10-Schema](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/) can express the outcome with the [outcome property](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/#outcome). In addition to `passed`, `failed` and `inapplicable`, EARL 1.0 also defined an `incomplete` outcome. While this cannot be the outcome of an ACT Rule when applied in its entirety, it often happens that rules are only partially evaluated. For example, when applicability was automated, but the expectations have to be evaluated manually. Such "interim" results can be expressed with the `incomplete` outcome.

### Same resource {#same-resource}

Two or more resources can be the _same resource_ even though the URLs for them are different. This can be due to URL parsing, server settings, redirects and DNS aliasing.

If the [parsed URLs](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#resolving-urls) for two resources are identical, the resources are the same resource.

Depending on the server, URLs can either be case-sensitive or case-insensitive, meaning that `<a href="page1.html">` and `<a href="Page1.html">` lead to either the same or two different pages.

Fully parsed URLs can be different, but still lead to the same resource after making the HTTP request, due to redirects and DNS aliasing. For example, these URLs are all fully normalized: http://example.com/, http://www.example.com/, https://www.example.com/. The server can however be configured to serve the same site for http and https, and the same site for example.com and www.example.com. This is common, but not guaranteed.

Some types of redirects are also caused by user agents, e.g. ensuring that http://example.com/ and http://example.com resolve to the same resource.

On the other hand, identical relative URLs do not necessarily resolve to the same resource, even if they are in the same [web page (HTML)](#web-page-html). This happen because external content can be included through `iframe` and URLs in or out of it will resolve relatively to different base URLs.

### Web page (HTML) {#web-page-html}

An _HTML [web page](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-web-page-s)_ is the set of all [fully active](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#fully-active) [documents](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-document) which share the same [top-level browsing context](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#top-level-browsing-context).

**Note:** Nesting of browsing context mostly happens with `iframe` and `object`. Thus a web page will most of the time be a "top-level" document and all its `iframe` and `object` (recursively).

**Note:** [Web pages](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-web-page-s) as defined by WCAG are not restricted to the HTML technology but can also include, _e.g._, PDF or DOCX documents.

**Note:** Although web pages as defined here are sets of [documents](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-document) (and do not contain other kind of nodes), one can abusively write that any node is "in a web page" if it is a [shadow-including descendant](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-shadow-including-descendant) of a [document](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-document) that is part of that web page.
