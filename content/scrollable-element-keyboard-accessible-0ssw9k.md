## Applicability

This rule applies to any HTML element that has [visible][] [children][] in the [flat tree][] for which at least one of the following is true:

- It has a [horizontal scroll distance][scrollable] greater than the [computed][] [left][padding-left] or [right padding][padding-right] of the element; or
- It has a [vertical scroll distance][scrollable] greater than the [computed][] [top][padding-top] or [bottom padding][padding-bottom] of the element

## Expectation

Each test target is either included in [sequential focus navigation][] or has a [descendant][] in the [flat tree][] that is included in [sequential focus navigation][].

## Assumptions

This rule assumes that all [scrollable elements][scrollable] with visible content need to be keyboard accessible. [Scrollable elements][scrollable] that do not need to be keyboard accessible, perhaps because their content is [purely decorative][] or because scroll can be controlled in some other keyboard accessible way such as through a button or custom scrollbar, may fail this rule but still satisfy [success criterion 2.1.1 Keyboard][].

## Accessibility Support

Some browsers will automatically make any [scrollable element][scrollable] focusable to ensure keyboard accessibility. However, the browser does not include these elements in [sequential focus navigation][] when it has a negative number as a tabindex [attribute value][].

## Background

To ensure there is some element from which arrow keys can be used to control the scroll position, focus must be on or in a scrollable region. If scripts are used to prevent the keyboard events from reaching the scrollable region, this could still cause a keyboard accessibility issue. This must be tested separately.

- [Understanding Success Criterion 2.1.1: Keyboard](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/keyboard.html)
- [G202: Ensuring keyboard control for all functionality](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G202)

## Test Cases

### Passed

#### Passed Example 1

This [scrollable][] `section` element is included in [sequential focus navigation][] because it has a `tabindex` attribute set to `0`.

```html
<section style="height: 100px; width: 500px; overflow: scroll;" tabindex="0">
	<h1>WCAG 2.1 Abstract</h1>
	<p>
		Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 covers a wide range of recommendations for making Web content more
		accessible. Following these guidelines will make content more accessible to a wider range of people with
		disabilities, including accommodations for blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, limited movement,
		speech disabilities, photosensitivity, and combinations of these, and some accommodation for learning disabilities
		and cognitive limitations; but will not address every user need for people with these disabilities. These guidelines
		address accessibility of web content on desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices. Following these guidelines
		will also often make Web content more usable to users in general.
	</p>
</section>
```

#### Passed Example 2

This [scrollable][] `section` element contains a link that is included in [sequential focus navigation][].

```html
<section style="height: 100px; width: 500px; overflow: scroll;">

		disabilities, including accommodations for blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, limited movement,
		speech disabilities, photosensitivity, and combinations of these, and some accommodation for learning disabilities
		and cognitive limitations; but will not address every user need for people with these disabilities. These guidelines
		address accessibility of web content on desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices. Following these guidelines
		will also often make Web content more usable to users in general.
	</p>

## Glossary

### Attribute value {#attribute-value}

The _attribute value_ of a content attribute set on an HTML element is the value that the attribute gets after being parsed and computed according to specifications. It may differ from the value that is actually written in the HTML code due to trimming whitespace or non-digits characters, default values, or case-insensitivity.

Some notable case of attribute value, among others:

- For [enumerated attributes][], the _attribute value_ is either the state of the attribute, or the keyword that maps to it; even for the default states. Thus `<input type="image" />` has an attribute value of either `Image Button` (the state) or `image` (the keyword mapping to it), both formulations having the same meaning; similarly, "an input element with a `type` _attribute value_ of `Text`" can be either `<input type="text" />`, `<input />` (missing value default), or `<input type="invalid" />` (invalid value default).
- For [boolean attributes][], the _attribute value_ is `true` when the attribute is present and `false` otherwise. Thus `<button disabled>`, `<button disabled="disabled">` and `<button disabled="">` all have a `disabled` _attribute value_ of `true`.
- For attributes whose value is used in a case-insensitive context, the _attribute value_ is the lowercase version of the value written in the HTML code.
- For attributes that accept [numbers][], the _attribute value_ is the result of parsing the value written in the HTML code according to the rules for parsing this kind of number.
- For attributes that accept sets of tokens, whether [space separated][] or [comma separated][], the _attribute value_ is the set of tokens obtained after parsing the set and, depending on the case, converting its items to lowercase (if the set is used in a case-insensitive context).
- For `aria-*` attributes, the _attribute value_ is computed as indicated in the [WAI-ARIA specification][] and the [HTML Accessibility API Mappings][html aam].

This list is not exhaustive, and only serves as an illustration for some of the most common cases.

The _attribute value_ of an [IDL attribute][] is the value returned on getting it. Note that when an [IDL attribute][] [reflects][reflect] a content attribute, they have the same attribute value.

### Outcome {#outcome}

An _outcome_ is a conclusion that comes from evaluating an ACT Rule on a [test subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-subject) or one of its constituent [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target). An outcome can be one of the three following types:

- **Inapplicable:** No part of the test subject matches the applicability
- **Passed:** A [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target) meets all expectations
- **Failed:** A [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target) does not meet all expectations

**Note:** A rule has one `passed` or `failed` outcome for every [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target). When there are no test targets the rule has one `inapplicable` outcome. This means that each [test subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-subject) will have one or more outcomes.

**Note:** Implementations using the [EARL10-Schema](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/) can express the outcome with the [outcome property](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/#outcome). In addition to `passed`, `failed` and `inapplicable`, EARL 1.0 also defined an `incomplete` outcome. While this cannot be the outcome of an ACT Rule when applied in its entirety, it often happens that rules are only partially evaluated. For example, when applicability was automated, but the expectations have to be evaluated manually. Such "interim" results can be expressed with the `incomplete` outcome.

### Scrollable Elements {#scrollable-element}

A scrollable element is an [element][] with a _horizontal scroll distance_ or a _vertical scroll distance_ greater than 0.

- **horizontal scroll distance**: The difference between [scrollWidth][] and [clientWidth] for elements where the [computed][] [overflow-x][] is `auto` or `scroll`. Undefined for other elements.

- **vertical scroll distance**: The difference between [scrollHeight][] and [clientHeight] for elements where the [computed][] [overflow-y][] is `auto` or `scroll`. Undefined for other elements.

**note**: Elements such as `iframe` which can render a [nested browsing context][] are not _scrollable elements_. The scrollbars on some `iframe` elements come from the content inside the [nested browsing context][].

### Visible {#visible}

Content perceivable through sight.

Content is considered _visible_ if making it fully transparent would result in a difference in the pixels rendered for any part of the document that is currently within the viewport or can be brought into the viewport via scrolling.

[Content is defined in WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-content).

For more details, see [examples of visible](https://act-rules.github.io/pages/examples/visible/).
