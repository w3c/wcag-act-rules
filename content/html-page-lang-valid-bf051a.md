## Applicability

This rule applies to any [document element](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#document-element) if it is an `html` element for which all the following are true:

- has a `lang` attribute that is neither empty ("") nor only [ASCII whitespace](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-whitespace); and
- is in a [top-level browsing context](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#top-level-browsing-context); and
- has a [node document](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-node-document) with a [content type](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-document-content-type) of `text/html`.

## Expectation

For each test target, the `lang` attribute has a [known primary language tag][].

## Assumptions

- The language of the page can be set by other methods than the `lang` attribute, for example using HTTP headers or the `meta` element. These methods are not supported by all assistive technologies. This rule assumes that these other methods are insufficient to satisfying [Success Criterion 3.1.1: Language of Page](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#language-of-page).

- This rule assumes that user agents and assistive technologies can programmatically determine [known primary language tags][known primary language tag] even if these do not conform to the [RFC 5646][] syntax.

- This rule assumes that only [known primary language tags][known primary language tag] are enough to satisfy [Success Criterion 3.1.1 Language of Page][sc311]; this notably excludes [grandfathered tags][] and [ISO 639.2][] three-letters codes, both having poor support in assistive technologies.

## Accessibility Support

_There are no major accessibility support issues known for this rule._

## Background

This rule is only applicable to non-embedded HTML pages. HTML pages embedded into other documents, such as through `iframe` or `object` elements are not applicable because they are not [web pages](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-web-page-s) according to the definition in WCAG.

```html
<html lang="fr"></html>
```

#### Passed Example 2

## Glossary

### Known Primary Language Tag {#known-primary-language-tag}

A language tag has a _known primary language tag_ if its [primary language subtag][] exists in the [language subtag registry][] with a [Type field][] whose field-body value is `language`.

A "language tag" is here to be understood as in the first paragraph of the [RFC 5646 language tag syntax][language tag], i.e. a sequence of subtags separated by hyphens, where a subtag is any sequence of alphanumerical characters. [Language tag][] that are not valid according to the stricter [RFC 5646 syntax][language tag] (and ABNF grammar) definition can still have a known primary language tag. User agents and assistive technologies are more lenient in what they accept. This definition is consistent with the behavior of the `:lang()` pseudo-selector as defined by [Selectors Level 3][].

As an example, `de-hello` would be an accepted way to indicate German in current user agents and assistive technologies, despite not being valid according to [RFC 5646 grammar][language tag]. It has a known primary language tag (namely, `de`).

As a consequence of this definition, however, [grandfathered tags][] do not have a known primary language tag.

Subtags, notably the [primary language subtag][], are [case insensitive][]. Comparison with the [language subtag registry][] must be done in a case insensitive way.

### Outcome {#outcome}

An _outcome_ is a conclusion that comes from evaluating an ACT Rule on a [test subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-subject) or one of its constituent [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target). An outcome can be one of the three following types:

- **Inapplicable:** No part of the test subject matches the applicability
- **Passed:** A [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target) meets all expectations
- **Failed:** A [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target) does not meet all expectations

**Note:** A rule has one `passed` or `failed` outcome for every [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target). When there are no test targets the rule has one `inapplicable` outcome. This means that each [test subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-subject) will have one or more outcomes.

**Note:** Implementations using the [EARL10-Schema](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/) can express the outcome with the [outcome property](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/#outcome). In addition to `passed`, `failed` and `inapplicable`, EARL 1.0 also defined an `incomplete` outcome. While this cannot be the outcome of an ACT Rule when applied in its entirety, it often happens that rules are only partially evaluated. For example, when applicability was automated, but the expectations have to be evaluated manually. Such "interim" results can be expressed with the `incomplete` outcome.
