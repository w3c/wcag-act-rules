## Applicability

This rule applies to any [HTML web page][].

## Expectations

Within each test target, either there is no [non-repeated content after repeated content][] or there exists an element for which all the following are true:

- the element has [semantic role][] inheriting from `landmark`; and
- the first [perceivable content][] (in [tree order][] in the [flat tree][]) which is an [inclusive descendant][] of the element is [non-repeated content after repeated content][]; and
- the element is [included in the accessibility tree][].

## Assumptions

- This rule assumes that [landmarks][landmark] are intended to users of Assistive Technologies and are not necessarily rendered in a visible way. Therefore, it does not require the main landmark to be [visible][]. Similarly, technique [ARIA11: Using ARIA landmarks to identify regions of a page][tech aria11] does not require landmarks to be [visible][] or have [visible][] content.

## Accessibility Support

Marking content with landmarks is sufficient to pass [Success Criterion 2.4.1 Bypass blocks][sc241]. However, this will only benefit users who can actually navigate using landmark roles (such a functionality is usually provided by assistive technologies, but could also be provided by browsers or browsers plugins). Users without any possibility for landmarks navigation will be left without way of bypassing blocks of repeated content and will still experience accessibility issues. Therefore, it is recommended to provide other ways of bypassing blocks.

## Background

Most of the time, this rule passes by enclosing the primary content of the page in a `main` landmark.

[Technique ARIA11: Using ARIA landmarks to identify regions of a page][tech aria11] only checks that landmarks are correctly used, but does not check whether landmarks could have been used and were omitted. Therefore, failing this rule (not having enough landmarks) does not necessarily fail that technique, and it is not listed as an accessibility mapping.

- [Technique ARIA11: Using ARIA landmarks to identify regions of a page][tech aria11]
- [ARIA Landmarks Example](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/landmarks/index.html)
- [CSS scoping (work in progress)](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scoping/)
- [The `main` role](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#main)

In most examples, the `nav` element is a [block of repeated content][].

### Inapplicable

#### Inapplicable Example 1

This [document][] is not an [HTML web page][].

```svg
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <title>This is an SVG</title>
</svg>
```

## Glossary

### Block of content {#block-of-content}

A _block of content_ in an [HTML web page][] is a set of nodes from that page for which all the following are true:

- **content**: there is at least one node which is [perceivable content][] in the block; and
- **continuity**: if two nodes are in the block, then any node between them (in tree order) is also in the block; and
- **downward closure**: if a node is in the block, then all its descendants are also in the block; and
- **parent closure**: if all children of a node are in the block, then this node is also in the block.

### Block of repeated content {#block-of-repeated-content}

A [block of content][] B, inside an [HTML web page][] P, is a _block of repeated content_ if both the following are true:

- **distance 1**: there exist an [instrument][] in P which leads the user to another [HTML web page][] P' whose URL has a different [host][], [port][] (including [default port][] for [special URL][]), or [path][]; and
- **repeated**: there exist a [block of content][] in P' which is [equivalent][equivalent resource] to B.

### Equivalent resource {#equivalent-resource}

Non-identical resources can still be _equivalent resources_ by equally complying to the expectation formed by the user when navigating to them, thus serving an equivalent purpose. This would usually involve that the advertised key content is the same.

Web pages and documents (e.g. PDFs, office formats etc.) may be equivalent resources, even if the resources:

- are located on different URLs, including different domains
- present different navigation options, e.g. through bread crumbs or local sub menus
- contain different amounts of information and/or differently worded information
- use different layouts.

If all resources cover the user's expectations equally well, the resources are considered to be equivalent.

**Note:** The user's expectations for the resource can be formed by different things, e.g. the name of the link leading to the resource, with or without the context around the link. This depends on the accessibility requirement that is tested.

**Note:** If the same content is presented in different formats or languages, the format or language itself is often part of the purpose of the content, e.g. an article as both HTML and PDF, an image in different sizes, or an article in two different languages. If getting the same content in different formats or languages is the purpose of having separate links, the resources are not equivalent.

### Explicit Semantic Role {#explicit-role}

The _explicit semantic role_ of an element is determined by its [role attribute][] (if any).

The [role attribute][] takes a list of tokens. The explicit semantic role is the first valid role in this list. The valid roles are all non-abstract roles from [WAI-ARIA Specifications][]. If the element has no [role attribute][], or if it has one with no valid role, then this element has no explicit semantic role.

Other roles may be added as they become available. Not all roles will be supported in all assistive technologies. Testers are encouraged to adjust which roles are allowed according to the [accessibility support base line][]. For the purposes of executing test cases in all rules, it should be assumed that all roles are supported by assistive technologies so that none of the roles fail due to lack of accessibility support.

### Focusable {#focusable}

Elements that can become the target of keyboard input as described in the [HTML](https://www.w3.org/TR/html) specification of [focusable](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#focusable-area) and [can be focused](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#specially-focusable).

### Hidden State {#hidden-state}

An HTML element's _hidden state_ is "true" if at least one of the following is true for itself or any of its [ancestors][] in the [flat tree][]:

- has a `hidden` attribute; or
- has a [computed][] CSS property `display` of `none`; or
- has a [computed][] CSS property `visibility` of `hidden`; or
- has an `aria-hidden` attribute set to `true`

In any other case, the element's _hidden state_ is "false".

### Implicit Semantic Role {#implicit-role}

The _implicit semantic role_ of an element is a pre-defined value given by the host language which depends on the element and its ancestors.

Implicit roles for HTML and SVG, are documented in the [HTML accessibility API mappings (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam/#html-element-role-mappings) and the [SVG accessibility API mappings (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg-aam/#mapping_role_table).

### Included in the accessibility tree {#included-in-the-accessibility-tree}

Elements included in the accessibility tree of platform specific accessibility APIs. Elements in the accessibility tree are exposed to assistive technologies, allowing users to interact with the elements in a way that meet the requirements of the individual user.

The general rules for when elements are included in the accessibility tree are defined in the [core accessibility API mappings](https://www.w3.org/TR/core-aam/). For native markup languages, such as HTML and SVG, additional rules for when elements are included in the accessibility tree can be found in the [HTML accessibility API mappings (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam/) and the [SVG accessibility API mappings (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg-aam/).

For more details, see [examples of included in the accessibility tree][].

**Note:** Users of assistive technologies might still be able to interact with elements that are not included in the accessibility tree. An example of this is a [focusable](#focusable) element with an `aria-hidden` attribute with a value of `true`. Such an element could still be interacted using sequential keyboard navigation regardless of the assistive technologies used, even though the element would not be included in the accessibility tree.
[examples of included in the accessibility tree]: https://act-rules.github.io/pages/examples/included-in-the-accessibility-tree/

### Instrument to achieve an objective {#instrument-to-achieve-an-objective}

An [HTML element][] that when [activated][] allows an end-user to achieve an objective.

**Note**: Any rule that uses this definition must provide an unambiguous description of the objective the instrument is used to achieve.

### Marked as decorative {#marked-as-decorative}

An element is _marked as decorative_ if one or more of the following conditions is true:

- it has an [explicit role][] of `none` or `presentation`; or
- it is an `img` element with an `alt` attribute whose value is the empty string (`alt=""`), and with no [explicit role][].

Elements are marked as decorative as a way to convey the intention of the author that they are [pure decoration][]. It is different from the element actually being [pure decoration][] as authors may make mistakes. It is different from the element being effectively ignored by assistive technologies as rules such as [presentational roles conflict resolution][] may overwrite this intention.

Elements can also be ignored by assistive technologies if their [hidden state][] is true. This is different from marking the element as decorative and does not convey the same intention. Notably, the [hidden state][] of an element may change as users interact with the page (showing and hiding elements) while being marked as decorative should stay the same through all states of the page.

### Non-repeated content after repeated content {#non-repeated-content}

A node is _non-repeated content after repeated content_ if all the following are true:

- the node is [perceivable content][]; and
- the node is not part of any [block of repeated content][]; and
- the node is after (in [tree order][] in the [flat tree][]) at least one [block of repeated content][].

### Outcome {#outcome}

An _outcome_ is a conclusion that comes from evaluating an ACT Rule on a [test subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-subject) or one of its constituent [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target). An outcome can be one of the three following types:

- **Inapplicable:** No part of the test subject matches the applicability
- **Passed:** A [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target) meets all expectations
- **Failed:** A [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target) does not meet all expectations

**Note:** A rule has one `passed` or `failed` outcome for every [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target). When there are no test targets the rule has one `inapplicable` outcome. This means that each [test subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-subject) will have one or more outcomes.

**Note:** Implementations using the [EARL10-Schema](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/) can express the outcome with the [outcome property](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/#outcome). In addition to `passed`, `failed` and `inapplicable`, EARL 1.0 also defined an `incomplete` outcome. While this cannot be the outcome of an ACT Rule when applied in its entirety, it often happens that rules are only partially evaluated. For example, when applicability was automated, but the expectations have to be evaluated manually. Such "interim" results can be expressed with the `incomplete` outcome.

### Perceivable content {#perceivable-content}

A node is _perceivable content_ if all the following are true:

- the node is [palpable content][]; and
- the node is either [visible][] or [included in the accessibility tree][]; and
- if the node is an element, it does not have a [semantic role][] of `none` or `presentation`.

Perceivable content corresponds to nodes that contain information and are perceived by some categories of users.

### Semantic Role {#semantic-role}

The _semantic role_ of an element is determined by the first of these cases that applies:

1. **Conflict** If the element is [marked as decorative][], but the element is [included in the accessibility tree][]; or would be [included in the accessibility tree][] when its [hidden state][] is false, then its _semantic role_ is its **[implicit role][]**.
1. **Explicit** If the element has an [explicit role][], then its _semantic role_ is its [explicit role][].
1. **Implicit** The _semantic role_ of the element is its [implicit role][].

### Visible {#visible}

Content perceivable through sight.

Content is considered _visible_ if making it fully transparent would result in a difference in the pixels rendered for any part of the document that is currently within the viewport or can be brought into the viewport via scrolling.

[Content is defined in WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-content).

For more details, see [examples of visible](https://act-rules.github.io/pages/examples/visible/).

### WAI-ARIA specifications {#wai-aria-specifications}

The _WAI ARIA Specifications_ group both the WAI ARIA W3C Recommendation and ARIA modules, namely:

- [Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/)
- [WAI-ARIA Graphics Module 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/graphics-aria-1.0/)
- [Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/dpub-aria-1.0/)

**Note:** depending on the type of content being evaluated, part of the specifications might be irrelevant and should be ignored.

### Web page (HTML) {#web-page-html}

An _HTML [web page](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-web-page-s)_ is the set of all [fully active](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#fully-active) [documents](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-document) which share the same [top-level browsing context](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#top-level-browsing-context).

**Note:** Nesting of browsing context mostly happens with `iframe` and `object`. Thus a web page will most of the time be a "top-level" document and all its `iframe` and `object` (recursively).

**Note:** [Web pages](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-web-page-s) as defined by WCAG are not restricted to the HTML technology but can also include, _e.g._, PDF or DOCX documents.

**Note:** Although web pages as defined here are sets of [documents](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-document) (and do not contain other kind of nodes), one can abusively write that any node is "in a web page" if it is a [shadow-including descendant](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-shadow-including-descendant) of a [document](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-document) that is part of that web page.
