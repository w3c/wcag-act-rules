		<p>
			The Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules Format 1.0 defines a format for writing accessibility test
			rules. These test rules can be used for developing automated testing tools and manual testing methodologies. It
			provides a common format that allows any party involved in accessibility testing to document and share their
			testing procedures in a robust and understandable manner. This enables transparency and harmonization of testing
			methods, including methods implemented by accessibility test tools.
