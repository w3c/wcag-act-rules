# Commit any change to the wcag-mapping.json file to the wcag repo as act-mapping.json
#
# Notes:
# - parameters can be set in the env section 
# - the source filename needs to be set in two places below
#  - in the on: trigger definition
#  - in env
# - A Personal Access Token (PAT) stored as a secret is required for the push to work
#   - Suggest this is set in a specific W3C account, rather a user account, so not accidently deleted
# - GitHub shows in the commit message a linkto the ACT repo commit
