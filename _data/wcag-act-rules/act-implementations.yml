    For these results, all rules including “experimental” rules are enabled.

    ACT rule results were generated using the latest `accessibility-checker` 
    from NPM using the [ACT test driver](https://github.com/IBMa/equal-access/tree/master/accessibility-checker/test-act).
    Results were created using the `preview` archive and the `IBM_Accessibility` policy.
    Mappings from ACT Rules to Accessibility Checker rule ids and reason codes can be 
    found in [`act_aligned.json`](https://github.com/IBMa/equal-access/blob/master/accessibility-checker/test-act/act_aligned.json) 
    and [`ace_mapping.js`](https://github.com/IBMa/equal-access/blob/master/accessibility-checker/test-act/ace_mapping.js). 
    Results indicate the rule ids and reason codes related to the ACT rule are  generated in the following format: 

    `RuleId1:ReasonCode1,ReasonCode2|RuleId2:ReasonCode3,ReasonCode4`.
