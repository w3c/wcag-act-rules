    ACT Rules are tested using a canary version of axe-core, which can be accessed by installing <code>axe-core@next</code> from NPM. 
    For these results, all rules including “experimental” rules are enabled. 
    Checks with “unsupported” in its ID are disabled, which deal with issues of accessibility support issues which ACT Rules do not account for, often by design.

    ACT rule results were generated using the latest `accessibility-checker` 
    from NPM using the [ACT test driver](https://github.com/IBMa/equal-access/tree/master/accessibility-checker/test-act).
    Results were created using the `preview` archive and the `IBM_Accessibility` policy.
    Mappings from ACT Rules to Accessibility Checker rule ids and reason codes can be 
    found in [`act_aligned.json`](https://github.com/IBMa/equal-access/blob/master/accessibility-checker/test-act/act_aligned.json) 
    and [`ace_mapping.js`](https://github.com/IBMa/equal-access/blob/master/accessibility-checker/test-act/ace_mapping.js). 
    Results indicate the rule ids and reason codes related to the ACT rule are  generated in the following format: 

    `RuleId1:ReasonCode1,ReasonCode2|RuleId2:ReasonCode3,ReasonCode4`.
